abstract:
- content: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are commonly used for improving the End
    User experience of a content delivery service while keeping cost at a reasonable
    level.  This document focuses on use cases that correspond to identified industry
    needs and that are expected to be realized once open interfaces and protocols
    supporting the interconnection of CDNs are specified and implemented.  This document
    can be used to motivate the definition of the requirements to be supported by
    CDN Interconnection (CDNI) interfaces.  It obsoletes RFC 3570.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
