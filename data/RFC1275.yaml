abstract:
  content: This RFC considers certain deficiencies of the 1988 X.500 standard, which
    need to be addressed before an effective open Internet Directory can be established
    using these protocols and services [CCI88].  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
