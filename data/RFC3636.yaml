abstract:
- content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs).  This
    memo obsoletes RFC 2668.  This memo extends that specification by including management
    information useful for the management of 10 gigabit per second (Gb/s) MAUs.  This
    memo also obsoletes RFC 1515.
