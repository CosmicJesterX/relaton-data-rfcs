abstract:
  content: This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning Tree
    capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t and P802.1w amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D-1998
    for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.  The objects in this MIB
    are defined to apply both to transparent bridging and to bridges connected by
    subnetworks other than LAN segments. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
