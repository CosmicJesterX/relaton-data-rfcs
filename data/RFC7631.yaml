abstract:
  content: This document reorganizes the naming of already-allocated TLV (type- length-value)
    types and type extensions in the "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) Parameters" registries
    defined by RFC 5444 to use names appropriately. It has no consequences in terms
    of any protocol implementation. This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines
    in RFC 5444, so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of future TLV type
    and type extension allocations. It makes no other changes to RFC 5444.
