abstract:
  content: This document presents objectives for an interoperable protocol for the
    Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP).  The document aims
    to establish a set of focused requirements for the development and evaluation
    of a CAPWAP protocol.  The objectives address architecture, operation, security,
    and network operator requirements that are necessary to enable interoperability
    among Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) devices of alternative designs.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
