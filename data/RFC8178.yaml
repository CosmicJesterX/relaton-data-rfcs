abstract:
- content: This document describes the rules relating to the extension of the NFSv4
    family of protocols.  It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition of
    optional features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in features
    already published as Proposed Standards.  The rules relating to the construction
    of minor versions and the interaction of minor version implementations that appear
    in this document supersede the minor versioning rules in RFC 5661 and other RFCs
    defining minor versions.
