abstract:
  content: The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a protocol for disseminating
    the same content to a group of interested parties in a streaming fashion.  PPSPP
    supports streaming of both prerecorded (on- demand) and live audio/video content.  It
    is based on the peer-to- peer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are
    put on equal footing with the servers initially providing the content, to create
    a system where everyone can potentially provide upload bandwidth.  It has been
    designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end user and to prevent disruption
    of the streams by malicious peers.  PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible
    and extensible.  It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer uploading, prevent
    freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers
    or Distributed Hash Tables).  It supports multiple methods for content integrity
    protection and chunk addressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run
    on top of various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using Low
    Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) for congestion control.
