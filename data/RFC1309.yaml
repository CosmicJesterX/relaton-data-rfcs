  content: This document is an overview of the X.500 standard for people not familiar
    with the technology.  It compares and contrasts Directory Services based on X.500
    with several of the other Directory services currently in use in the Internet.  This
    paper also describes the status of the standard and provides references for further
    information on X.500 implementations and technical information.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
