abstract:
- content: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is heavily used in Service Provider networks
    for both Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services.  For resiliency purposes, redundant
    routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce the consequences of an Autonomous
    System Border Router (ASBR) or BGP session breakdown on customers' or peers' traffic.  However,
    simply taking down or even bringing up a BGP session for maintenance purposes
    may still induce connectivity losses during the BGP convergence.  This is no longer
    satisfactory for new applications (e.g., voice over IP, online gaming, VPN).  Therefore,
    a solution is required for the graceful shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s)
    in order to limit the amount of traffic loss during a planned shutdown.  This
    document expresses requirements for such a solution.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
