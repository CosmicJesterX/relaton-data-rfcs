abstract:
  content: Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for
    use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).  It uniquely and
    reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string.  ASCII characters
    in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are
    represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters,
    digits, and hyphens).  This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring
    that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of
    code points drawn from a larger set.  Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that
    uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA.
