abstract:
- content: This document describes Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) protection scenarios
    in which pseudowire redundancy is provided on the Switching Provider Edge (S-PE)
    as defined in RFC 5659.  Operations of the S-PEs that provide PW redundancy are
    specified in this document.  Signaling of the Preferential Forwarding status as
    defined in RFCs 6870 and 6478 is reused.  This document does not require any change
    to the Terminating Provider Edges (T-PEs) of MS-PW.
