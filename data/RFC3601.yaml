abstract:
  content: 'This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a text
    string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed of Dual Tone
    Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and additional "actions" (such
    as "wait for dialtone", "pause for N secs", etc.) which could be needed to successfully
    establish the connection with the target service: this includes the cases where
    subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.'
