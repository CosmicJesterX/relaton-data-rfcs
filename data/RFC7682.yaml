abstract:
  content: The purpose of this document is to catalog issues that influenced the efficacy
    of Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) for inter-domain routing policy specification
    and application in the global routing system over the past two decades.  Additionally,
    it provides a discussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic
    in practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer applicable but
    continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based filtering adoption and IRR utility
    to this day.
