abstract:
- content: This document specifies the conventions for using the Hierarchical Signature
    System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) hash-based signature algorithm
    with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  The HSS/LMS algorithm
    is one form of hash-based digital signature; it is described in RFC 8554.
