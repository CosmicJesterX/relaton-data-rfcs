abstract:
  content: Although TRILL is based on IS-IS, which supports multilevel unicast routing,
    extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are not addressed by the
    already-existing capabilities of IS-IS. One issue is with the handling of multi-destination
    packet distribution trees. Other issues are with TRILL switch nicknames. How are
    such nicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network? Do nicknames need
    to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network? Or can they merely be
    unique within each multilevel area? This informational document enumerates and
    examines alternatives based on a number of factors including backward compatibility,
    simplicity, and scalability; it makes recommendations in some cases.
