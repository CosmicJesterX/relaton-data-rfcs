abstract:
- content: This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    scheme, corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 6, for the RaptorQ FEC code and its application
    to reliable delivery of data objects. RaptorQ codes are a new family of codes
    that provide superior flexibility, support for larger source block sizes, and
    better coding efficiency than Raptor codes in RFC 5053. RaptorQ is also a fountain
    code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated on the fly by
    the encoder from the source symbols of a source block of data. The decoder is
    able to recover the source block from almost any set of encoding symbols of sufficient
    cardinality -- in most cases, a set of cardinality equal to the number of source
    symbols is sufficient; in rare cases, a set of cardinality slightly more than
    the number of source symbols is required. The RaptorQ code described here is a
    systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding symbols
    that can be generated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
