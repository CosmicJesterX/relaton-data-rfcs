abstract:
  content: Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps that are
    incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as "packet timestamps"
    for short.  This document specifies guidelines for defining packet timestamp formats
    in networking protocols at various layers.  It also presents three recommended
    timestamp formats.  The target audience of this document includes network protocol
    designers.  It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet
    timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats.  If
    none of the recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol
    specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the
    guidelines in this document.
