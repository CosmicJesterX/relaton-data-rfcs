abstract:
  content: The Mobile IP specification establishes the mechanisms that enable a mobile
    host to maintain and use the same IP address as it changes its point of attachment
    to the network.  The mechanisms described in this document allow a mobile node
    out on a public sector of the internet to negotiate access past a SKIP firewall,
    and construct a secure channel into its home network.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.
