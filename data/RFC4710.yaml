abstract:
- content: There is a need to monitor end-devices such as IP phones, pagers, Instant
    Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other handheld computing devices.  This
    memo extends the remote network monitoring (RMON) family of specifications to
    allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS) monitoring of various applications that
    run on these devices and allows this information to be integrated with the RMON
    family using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  This memo defines
    the framework, architecture, relevant metrics, and transport requirements for
    real-time QoS monitoring of applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
