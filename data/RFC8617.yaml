abstract:
- content: The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol provides an authenticated
    "chain of custody" for a message, allowing each entity that handles the message
    to see what entities handled it before and what the message's authentication assessment
    was at each step in the handling. ARC allows Internet Mail Handlers to attach
    assertions of message authentication assessment to individual messages. As messages
    traverse ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers, additional ARC assertions can be
    attached to messages to form ordered sets of ARC assertions that represent the
    authentication assessment at each step of the message-handling paths. ARC-enabled
    Internet Mail Handlers can process sets of ARC assertions to inform message disposition
    decisions, identify Internet Mail Handlers that might break existing authentication
    mechanisms, and convey original authentication assessments across trust boundaries.
