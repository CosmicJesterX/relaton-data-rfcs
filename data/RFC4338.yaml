abstract:
- content: This document specifies the way of encapsulating IPv6, IPv4, and Address
    Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets over Fibre Channel. This document also specifies
    the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured
    IPv6 addresses on Fibre Channel networks, and a mechanism to perform IPv4 address
    resolution over Fibre Channel networks. This document obsoletes RFC 2625 and RFC
    3831. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
