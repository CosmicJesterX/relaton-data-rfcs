abstract:
- content: The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework supporting
    multiple types of authentication methods.  In systems where EAP is used for authentication,
    it is desirable to not repeat the entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.  This
    document specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an
    EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer
    and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator.  The re-authentication
    server may be in the home network or in the local network to which the peer is
    connecting. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
