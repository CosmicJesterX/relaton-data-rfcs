abstract:
  content: This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each service
    to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy, etc.), and specifies
    what actions are to be taken by a submission server. Message relay and final delivery
    are unaffected, and continue to use SMTP over port 25. When conforming to this
    document, message submission uses the protocol specified here, normally over port
    587. This separation of function offers a number of benefits, including the ability
    to apply specific security or policy requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
