abstract:
  content: This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for video
    fast update in a tightly controlled environment, developed by Microsoft, Polycom,
    Radvision and used by multiple vendors.  This document describes a method that
    has been deployed in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based systems over the
    last three years and is being used across real-time interactive applications from
    different vendors in an interoperable manner.  New implementations are discouraged
    from using the method described except for backward compatibility purposes.  New
    implementations are required to use the new Full Intra Request command in the
    RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) channel.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
