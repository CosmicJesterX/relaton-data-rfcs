abstract:
- content: This document defines the procedure to register RTP Payload Formats as
    audio, video or other MIME subtype names.  This is useful in a text- based format
    or control protocol to identify the type of an RTP transmission.  This document
    also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio
    and Video Conferences as MIME subtypes.  Some of these may also be used for transfer
    modes other than RTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
