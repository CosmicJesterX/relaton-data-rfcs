abstract:
- content: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version three (SNMPv3) requires
    that an application know the identifier (snmpEngineID) of the remote SNMP protocol
    engine in order to retrieve or manipulate objects maintained on the remote SNMP
    entity. This document introduces a well-known localEngineID and a discovery mechanism
    that can be used to learn the snmpEngineID of a remote SNMP protocol engine. The
    proposed mechanism is independent of the features provided by SNMP security models
    and may also be used by other protocol interfaces providing access to managed
    objects. This document updates RFC 3411. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
