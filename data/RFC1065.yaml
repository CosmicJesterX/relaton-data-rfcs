abstract:
  content: This RFC provides the common definitions for the structure and identification
    of management information for TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, together
    with its companion memos, which describe the initial management information base
    along with the initial network management protocol, these documents provide a
    simple, working architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and
    in particular, the Internet.  This memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet
    community.  TCP/IP implementation in the Internet which are network manageable
    are expected to adopt and implement this specification.
