abstract:
  content: This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)
    that are for Private Use only, known as Private Use ASNs, and provides operational
    guidance on their use.  This document enlarges the total space available for Private
    Use ASNs by documenting the reservation of a second, larger range and updates
    RFC 1930 by replacing Section 10 of that document.
