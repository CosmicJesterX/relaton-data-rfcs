abstract:
  content: This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile IPv6 operations
    using the RADIUS infrastructure.  The protocol defined in this document uses RADIUS-based
    interfaces of the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor with the
    AAA server for authentication, authorization, and policy functions.  The RADIUS
    interactions between the mobile access gateway and the RADIUS-based AAA server
    take place when the mobile node (MN) attaches, authenticates, and authorizes to
    a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  Furthermore, this document defines the RADIUS-based
    interface between the local mobility anchor and the AAA RADIUS server for authorizing
    received Proxy Binding Update messages for the mobile node's mobility session.  In
    addition to the interactions related to mobility session setup, this document
    defines the baseline for the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor
    generated accounting. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
