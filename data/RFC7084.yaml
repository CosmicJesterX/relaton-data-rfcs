abstract:
  content: This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router.  Specifically,
    the current version of this document focuses on the basic provisioning of an IPv6
    CE router and the provisioning of IPv6 hosts attached to it.  The document also
    covers IP transition technologies.  Two transition technologies in RFC 5969's
    IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) and RFC 6333's Dual-Stack
    Lite (DS-Lite) are covered in the document.  The document obsoletes RFC 6204.
