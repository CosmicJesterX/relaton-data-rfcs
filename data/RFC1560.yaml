abstract:
  content: 'There has recently been considerable discussion on two topics: MultiProtocol
    approaches in the Internet and the selection of a next generation Internet Protocol.  This
    document suggests a strawman position for goals and approaches for the IETF/IESG/IAB
    in these areas.  It takes the view that these two topics are related, and proposes
    directions for the IETF/IESG/IAB to pursue.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
    kind.'
