abstract:
  content: This document shows example call flows demonstrating the use of Transport
    Layer Security (TLS), and Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
    in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It also provides information that helps
    implementers build interoperable SIP software.  To help facilitate interoperability
    testing, it includes certificates used in the example call flows and processes
    to create certificates for testing.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
