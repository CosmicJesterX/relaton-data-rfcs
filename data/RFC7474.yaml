abstract:
  content: The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined in
    RFCs 2328 and 5709 is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra- session replay
    attacks when using manual keying. Additionally, the existing cryptographic authentication
    mechanism does not cover the IP header. This omission can be exploited to carry
    out various types of attacks. This document defines changes to the authentication
    sequence number mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and
    intra- session replay attacks when using manual keys for securing OSPFv2 protocol
    packets. Additionally, we also describe some changes in the cryptographic hash
    computation that will eliminate attacks resulting from OSPFv2 not protecting the
    IP header.
