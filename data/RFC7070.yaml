abstract:
- content: This document describes a general architecture for a reputation-based service,
    allowing one to request reputation-related data over the Internet, where "reputation"
    refers to predictions or expectations about an entity or an identifier such as
    a domain name.  The document roughly follows the recommendations of RFC 4101 for
    describing a protocol model.
