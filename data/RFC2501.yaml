abstract:
  content: This memo first describes the characteristics of Mobile Ad hoc Networks
    (MANETs), and their idiosyncrasies with respect to traditional, hardwired packet
    networks.  It then discusses the effect these differences have on the design and
    evaluation of network control protocols with an emphasis on routing performance
    evaluation considerations.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
