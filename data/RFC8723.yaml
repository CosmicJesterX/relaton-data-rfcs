abstract:
  content: In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary to
    be able to manipulate some parameters in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets,
    while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees.  This document defines
    a cryptographic transform for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that
    uses two separate but related cryptographic operations to provide hop-by-hop and
    end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic
    algorithms can utilize an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
    algorithm or take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.
