abstract:
  content: This document defines an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    to convey geographic location information from one SIP entity to another SIP entity.  The
    SIP extension covers end-to-end conveyance as well as location-based routing,
    where SIP intermediaries make routing decisions based upon the location of the
    Location Target. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
