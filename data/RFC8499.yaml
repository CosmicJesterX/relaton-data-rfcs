abstract:
- content: The Domain Name System (DNS) is defined in literally dozens of different
    RFCs. The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and
    by operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades since the DNS
    was first defined. This document gives current definitions for many of the terms
    used in the DNS in a single document. This document obsoletes RFC 7719 and updates
    RFC 2308.
