abstract:
- content: This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast
    data packets.  It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a "multicast
    domain".  However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast
    distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow
    state.  This architecture is known as "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER).  When
    a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set
    of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent.  The ingress router then
    encapsulates the packet in a BIER header.  The BIER header contains a bit string
    in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward
    the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers
    are set in the BIER header.  The procedures for forwarding a packet based on its
    BIER header are specified in this document.  Elimination of the per-flow state
    and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification.
