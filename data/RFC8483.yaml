abstract:
  content: Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production root server testbed that provides
    an environment where technical and operational experiments can safely be performed
    without risk to production root server infrastructure.  This document aims solely
    to document the technical and operational experience of deploying a system that
    is similar to but different from the Root Server system (on which the Internet's
    Domain Name System is designed and built).
