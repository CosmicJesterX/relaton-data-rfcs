abstract:
- content: A Segment Routing (SR) node steers a packet through a controlled set of
    instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR header. A segment
    can represent any instruction, topological or service based. SR allows enforcing
    a flow through any topological path while maintaining per-flow state only at the
    ingress node to the SR domain. The Segment Routing architecture can be directly
    applied to the MPLS data plane with no change in the forwarding plane. This document
    describes how Segment Routing MPLS operates in a network where LDP is deployed
    and in the case where SR-capable and non-SR-capable nodes coexist.
