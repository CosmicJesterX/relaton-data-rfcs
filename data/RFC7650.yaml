abstract:
  content: This document defines a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Usage for
    REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The CoAP Usage provides the functionality
    to federate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in a peer-to-peer fashion.  The CoAP
    Usage for RELOAD allows CoAP nodes to store resources in a RELOAD peer-to-peer
    overlay, provides a lookup service, and enables the use of RELOAD overlay as a
    cache for sensor data.  This functionality is implemented in the RELOAD overlay
    itself, without the use of centralized servers.  The RELOAD AppAttach method is
    used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which CoAP messages
    are exchanged.
