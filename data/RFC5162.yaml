abstract:
- content: This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client the
    ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as part of the
    SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or additional client round-trips.  This
    extension also introduces a new response that allows for a more compact representation
    of a list of expunged messages (and always includes the Unique Identifiers (UIDs)
    expunged). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
