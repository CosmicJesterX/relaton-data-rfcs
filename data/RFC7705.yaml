abstract:
  content: This document discusses some existing commonly used BGP mechanisms for
    Autonomous System Number (ASN) migration that are not formally part of the BGP4
    protocol specification.  It is necessary to document these de facto standards
    to ensure that they are properly supported in future BGP protocol work.
