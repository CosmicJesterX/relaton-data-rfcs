abstract:
  content: RFC 5239 defines centralized conferencing (XCON) as an association of participants
    with a central focus.  The state of a conference is represented by a conference
    object.  This document defines an XML- based conference information data model
    to be used for conference objects.  A conference information data model is designed
    to convey information about the conference and about participation in the conference.  The
    conference information data model defined in this document constitutes an extension
    of the data format specified in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    for conference State. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
