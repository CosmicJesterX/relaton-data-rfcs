abstract:
- content: A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse Path Forwarding
    (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface and router in order to build forwarding
    state.  When there are equal cost multipaths (ECMPs), existing implementations
    often use hash algorithms to select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the
    spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually
    leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document introduces
    the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs.  It allows
    ECMP selection to be based on administratively selected metrics, such as data
    transmission delays, path preferences, and routing metrics. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
