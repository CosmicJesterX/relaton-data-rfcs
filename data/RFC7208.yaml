abstract:
  content: Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular,
    existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the
    "MAIL FROM" of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands. This
    document describes version 1 of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby
    ADministrative Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts that
    are allowed to use their domain names, and a receiving host can check such authorization.
    This document obsoletes RFC 4408.
