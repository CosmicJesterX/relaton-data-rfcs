abstract:
  content: 'The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol
    supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches, including point-to-point
    links and multi-access Local Area Network (LAN) links that can have multiple TRILL
    switches and end stations attached.  TRILL uses Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) routing.  This document specifies the establishment, reporting,
    and termination of IS-IS adjacencies between TRILL switches, also known as RBridges
    (Routing Bridges).  It also concerns four other link-local aspects of TRILL: Designated
    RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation,
    and BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection
    with adjacency.  State diagrams are included where appropriate.  This document
    obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.'
