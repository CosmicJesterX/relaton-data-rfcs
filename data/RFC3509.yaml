abstract:
  content: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol
    used for routing in IP networks.  Though the definition of the Area Border Router
    (ABR) in the OSPF specification does not require a router with multiple attached
    areas to have a backbone connection, it is actually necessary to provide successful
    routing to the inter-area and external destinations.  If this requirement is not
    met, all traffic destined for the areas not connected to such an ABR or out of
    the OSPF domain, is dropped.  This document describes alternative ABR behaviors
    implemented in Cisco and IBM routers.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
