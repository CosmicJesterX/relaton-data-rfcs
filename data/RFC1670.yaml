abstract:
- content: This white paper expresses some personal opinions on IPng engineering considerations,
    based on experience with DECnet Phase V transition.  It suggests breaking down
    the IPng decisions and transition tasks into smaller parts so they can be tackled
    early by the relevant experts.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
