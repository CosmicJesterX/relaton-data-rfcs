abstract:
- content: This document describes BGPsec, an extension to the Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) that provides security for the path of Autonomous Systems (ASes) through
    which a BGP UPDATE message passes.  BGPsec is implemented via an optional non-transitive
    BGP path attribute that carries digital signatures produced by each AS that propagates
    the UPDATE message.  The digital signatures provide confidence that every AS on
    the path of ASes listed in the UPDATE message has explicitly authorized the advertisement
    of the route.
