abstract:
- content: RFC 4458 (regarding SIP URIs for applications) defines a "cause" URI parameter,
    which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to indicate
    a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the
    message.  This document updates RFC 4458 by creating a new predefined value for
    the "cause" URI parameter to cover service number translation for cases of retargeting
    due to specific service action leading to the translation of a called service
    access number.  This document also provides guidance, which was missing in RFC
    4458, for using the "cause" URI parameter within the History-Info header field,
    since this use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.
