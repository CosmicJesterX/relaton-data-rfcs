abstract:
  content: After an emergency call is completed (terminated either prematurely by
    the emergency caller or normally by the call taker), the call taker may feel the
    need for further communication. For example, the call may have been dropped by
    accident without the call taker having sufficient information about the current
    state of an accident victim. A call taker may trigger a callback to the emergency
    caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call.
    This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like any other call
    and, as a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get
    forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF emergency services architecture specification
    already offers a solution approach for allowing Public Safety Answering Point
    (PSAP) callbacks to bypass authorization policies in order to reach the caller
    without unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports
    limited scenarios. This document discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms
    and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal call treatment behavior
    would be desirable. We describe a solution based on a new header field value for
    the SIP Priority header field, called "psap-callback", to mark PSAP callbacks.
