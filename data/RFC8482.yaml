abstract:
  content: The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE) "ANY". The
    operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to respond to such queries
    for reasons of local policy, motivated by security, performance, or other reasons.
    The DNS specification does not include specific guidance for the behavior of DNS
    servers or clients in this situation. This document aims to provide such guidance.
    This document updates RFCs 1034 and 1035.
