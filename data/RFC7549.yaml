abstract:
- content: In 3GPP networks, the signaling path between a calling user and a called
    user can be partitioned into segments, referred to as traffic legs. Each traffic
    leg may span networks belonging to different operators and will have its own characteristics
    that can be different from other traffic legs in the same call. A traffic leg
    might be associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e.g., in case a Back-to-Back User
    Agent (B2BUA) that modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located within the traffic
    leg. This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl' (an abbreviation for
    Inter-Operator Traffic Leg). The parameter can be used in a SIP URI to indicate
    that the entity associated with the address, or an entity responsible for the
    host part of the address, represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple
    traffic legs).
