abstract:
  content: This document introduces a simple mechanism to associate a group of Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) via an extension to the Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) with the purpose of computing diverse (disjointed) paths for those
    LSPs.  The proposed extension allows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to advertise
    to a Path Computation Element (PCE) that a particular LSP belongs to a particular
    Disjoint Association Group; thus, the PCE knows that the LSPs in the same group
    need to be disjoint from each other.
