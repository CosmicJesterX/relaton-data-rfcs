abstract:
- content: An IPv4 or IPv6 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to flexibly
    manage the IP address-mapping and port-mapping information on Network Address
    Translators (NATs) or firewalls to facilitate communication with remote hosts.
    However, the uncontrolled generation or deletion of IP address mappings on such
    network devices may cause security risks and should be avoided. In some cases,
    the client may need to prove that it is authorized to modify, create, or delete
    PCP mappings. This document describes an in-band authentication mechanism for
    PCP that can be used in those cases. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    is used to perform authentication between PCP devices. This document updates RFC
    6887.
