abstract:
  content: 'This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    Schemes for the Raptor and RaptorQ codes and their application to reliable delivery
    of media streams in the context of the FEC Framework.  The Raptor and RaptorQ
    codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from
    a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the
    source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The Raptor
    and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against arbitrary packet losses
    at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC Schemes are defined: two for the protection
    of arbitrary packet flows, two that are optimized for small source blocks, and
    two for the protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.  Repair
    data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g., UDP) or using RTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
