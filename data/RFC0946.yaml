abstract:
  content: Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged
    in from usually including information about telephone extension and office occupants
    names.  The information is useful for physically locating people and/or calling
    them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed and implemented a terminal location database
    and modified existing network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal
    Location Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this mechanism
    into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is not viewed as a
    replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand
    mechansim for communicating terminal location information between hosts in a localized
    community.  This RFC proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
