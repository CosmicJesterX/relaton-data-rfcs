abstract:
  content: This document defines a Media Control Channel Framework Package for Interactive
    Voice Response (IVR) dialog interaction on media connections and conferences.  The
    package defines dialog management request elements for preparing, starting, and
    terminating dialog interactions, as well as associated responses and notifications.  Dialog
    interactions are specified in a dialog language.  This package defines a lightweight
    IVR dialog language (supporting prompt playback, runtime controls, Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency
    (DTMF) collection, and media recording) and allows other dialog languages to be
    used.  The package also defines elements for auditing package capabilities and
    IVR dialogs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
