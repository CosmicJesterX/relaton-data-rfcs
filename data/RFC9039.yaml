abstract:
  content: This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
    hardware device identifiers.  A general representation of device identity can
    be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage or
    in equipment inventories.  A URN-based representation can be passed along in applications
    that need the information.
