abstract:
  content: This document describes security guidelines for the softwire "Hubs and
    Spokes" and "Mesh" solutions.  Together with discussion of the softwire deployment
    scenarios, the vulnerability to security attacks is analyzed to provide security
    protection mechanisms such as authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to
    the softwire control and data packets. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
