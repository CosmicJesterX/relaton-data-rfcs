abstract:
  content: This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational media
    services such as interactive video.  The solution conforms to the packet conservation
    principle and uses a hybrid loss-and-delay- based congestion control algorithm.  The
    algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well
    as in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown to achieve both
    low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.
