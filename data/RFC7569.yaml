abstract:
- content: In the past, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very rigid
    policies that were implemented in particular protocols and platforms. As MAC systems
    become more widely deployed, additional flexibility in mechanism and policy will
    be required. While traditional trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security
    (MLS) and integrity models, modern systems have expanded to include such technologies
    as type enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms that need
    to be accommodated, it is unlikely that the use of a single security label format
    and model will be viable. To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to
    co-exist in a network, this document creates a registry of label format specifications.
    This registry contains label format identifiers and provides for the association
    of each such identifier with a corresponding extensive document outlining the
    exact syntax and use of the particular label format.
