abstract:
- content: This memo presents a problem statement for access rate measurement for
    test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).  Key rate measurement
    test protocol aspects include the ability to control packet characteristics on
    the tested path, such as asymmetric rate and asymmetric packet size.
