abstract:
- content: This document describes the requirements for SIP telephony devices, based
    on the deployment experience of large numbers of SIP phones and PC clients using
    different implementations in various networks. The objectives of the requirements
    are a well-defined set of interoperability and multi-vendor-supported core features,
    so as to enable similar ease of purchase, installation, and operation as found
    for PCs, PDAs, analog feature phones or mobile phones. We present a glossary of
    the most common settings and some of the more widely used values for some settings.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.
