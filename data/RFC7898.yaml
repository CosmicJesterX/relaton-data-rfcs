abstract:
- content: The Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) specification
    and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extensions to RSVP-TE
    allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly included in a path setup.
    Further, Exclude Route extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources
    to be explicitly excluded in a path setup. This document specifies new subobjects
    to include or exclude Autonomous Systems (ASes), which are identified by a 4-byte
    AS number, and Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas during path setup.
