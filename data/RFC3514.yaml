abstract:
  content: Firewalls, packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and the like often
    have difficulty distinguishing between packets that have malicious intent and
    those that are merely unusual.  We define a security flag in the IPv4 header as
    a means of distinguishing the two cases.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
