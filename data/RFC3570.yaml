abstract:
  content: In describing content internetworking as a technology targeted for use
    in production networks, it is useful to provide examples of the sequence of events
    that may occur when two content networks decide to interconnect.  The scenarios
    presented here seek to provide some concrete examples of what content internetworking
    is, and also to provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking proposals.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
