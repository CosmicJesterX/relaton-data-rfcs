abstract:
- content: This RFC defines a protocol to provide a mail checking service to be used
    between a client and server pair.  Typically, a small program on a client workstation
    would use the protocol to query a server in order to find out whether new mail
    has arrived for a specified user.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
