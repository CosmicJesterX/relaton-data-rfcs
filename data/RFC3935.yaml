abstract:
- content: This memo gives a mission statement for the IETF, tries to define the terms
    used in the statement sufficiently to make the mission statement understandable
    and useful, argues why the IETF needs a mission statement, and tries to capture
    some of the debate that led to this point.  This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.
