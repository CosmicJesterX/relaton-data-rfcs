abstract:
  content: OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where autoconfiguration
    is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6 home network where users expect
    to simply plug in a router and have it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain
    routing.  This document describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.  This
    document updates RFC 5340 by relaxing the HelloInterval/ RouterDeadInterval checking
    during OSPFv3 adjacency formation and adding hysteresis to the update of self-originated
    Link State Advertisements (LSAs).
