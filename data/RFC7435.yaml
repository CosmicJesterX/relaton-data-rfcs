abstract:
  content: This document defines the concept "Opportunistic Security" in the context
    of communications protocols.  Protocol designs based on Opportunistic Security
    use encryption even when authentication is not available, and use authentication
    when possible, thereby removing barriers to the widespread use of encryption on
    the Internet.
