abstract:
- content: Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined as consistent sets of network configuration
    information. PvDs allows hosts to manage connections to multiple networks and
    interfaces simultaneously, such as when a home router provides connectivity through
    both a broadband and cellular network provider. This document defines a mechanism
    for explicitly identifying PvDs through a Router Advertisement (RA) option. This
    RA option announces a PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate
    between PvDs. The option can directly carry some information about a PvD and can
    optionally point to PvD Additional Information that can be retrieved using HTTP
    over TLS.
