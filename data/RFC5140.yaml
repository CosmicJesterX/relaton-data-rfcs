abstract:
- content: This document describes the Telephony Gateway Registration Protocol (TGREP)
    for registration of telephony prefixes supported by telephony gateways and soft
    switches.  The registration mechanism can also be used to export resource information.  The
    prefix and resource information can then be passed on to a Telephony Routing over
    IP (TRIP) Location Server, which in turn can propagate that routing information
    within and between Internet Telephony Administrative Domains (ITADs).  TGREP shares
    a lot of similarities with the TRIP protocol.  It has similar procedures and finite
    state machine for session establishment.  It also shares the same format for messages
    and a subset of attributes with TRIP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
