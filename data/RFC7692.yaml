abstract:
  content: This document defines a framework for creating WebSocket extensions that
    add compression functionality to the WebSocket Protocol.  An extension based on
    this framework compresses the payload data portion of WebSocket data messages
    on a per-message basis using parameters negotiated during the opening handshake.  This
    framework provides a general method for applying a compression algorithm to the
    contents of WebSocket messages.  Each compression algorithm has to be defined
    in a document defining the extension by specifying the parameter negotiation and
    the payload transformation algorithm in detail.  This document also specifies
    one specific compression extension using the DEFLATE algorithm.
