abstract:
  content: The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet-based
    transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and pseudowire
    (PW) data-plane architectures. This document describes a framework to support
    a comprehensive set of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) procedures
    that fulfill the MPLS-TP OAM requirements for fault, performance, and protection-switching
    management and that do not rely on the presence of a control plane. This document
    is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation
    Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
