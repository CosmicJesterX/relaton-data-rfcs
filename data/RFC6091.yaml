abstract:
  content: This memo defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) extensions and associated
    semantics that allow clients and servers to negotiate the use of OpenPGP certificates
    for a TLS session, and specifies how to transport OpenPGP certificates via TLS.  It
    also defines the registry for non-X.509 certificate types.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
