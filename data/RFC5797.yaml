abstract:
- content: Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands, with
    the early ones summarized in RFC 959.  RFC 2389 established a mechanism for specifying
    and negotiating FTP extensions.  The number of extensions, both those supported
    by the mechanism and some that are not, continues to increase.  An IANA registry
    of FTP Command and Feature names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict
    of names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that registry.
