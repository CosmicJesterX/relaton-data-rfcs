abstract:
- content: This document defines a Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)
    Management Information Base (MIB) module for configuring the security policy database
    of a device implementing the IPsec protocol.  The policy-based packet filtering
    and the corresponding execution of actions described in this document are of a
    more general nature than for IPsec configuration alone, such as for configuration
    of a firewall.  This MIB module is designed to be extensible with other enterprise
    or standards-based defined packet filters and actions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
