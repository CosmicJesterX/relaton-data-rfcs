abstract:
  content: This document provides reference information for implementing a cross-protocol
    network proxy that performs translation from the HTTP protocol to the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP).  This will enable an HTTP client to access resources
    on a CoAP server through the proxy.  This document describes how an HTTP request
    is mapped to a CoAP request and how a CoAP response is mapped back to an HTTP
    response.  This includes guidelines for status code, URI, and media type mappings,
    as well as additional interworking advice.
