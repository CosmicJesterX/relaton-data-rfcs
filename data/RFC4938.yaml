abstract:
- content: This document extends the Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) Protocol
    with a credit-based flow control mechanism and Link Quality Metric report.  This
    optional extension should improve the performance of PPPoE over media with variable
    bandwidth and limited buffering, such as mobile radio links.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
