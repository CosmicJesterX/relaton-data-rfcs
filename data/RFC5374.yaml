abstract:
  content: The Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol describes security
    services for traffic at the IP layer.  That architecture primarily defines services
    for Internet Protocol (IP) unicast packets.  This document describes how the IPsec
    security services are applied to IP multicast packets.  These extensions are relevant
    only for an IPsec implementation that supports multicast. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
