abstract:
  content: This document provides a set of "torture tests" for implementers of the
    Signaling Compression (SigComp) protocol.  The torture tests check each of the
    SigComp Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine instructions in turn, focusing
    in particular on the boundary and error cases that are not generally encountered
    when running well-behaved compression algorithms.  Tests are also provided for
    other SigComp entities such as the dispatcher and the state handler.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
