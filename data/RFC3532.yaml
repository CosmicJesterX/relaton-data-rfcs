abstract:
- content: This document identifies a set of requirements for the mechanisms used
    to dynamically reallocate the resources of a switching element (e.g., an ATM switch)
    to its partitions.  These requirements are particularly critical in the case of
    an operator creating a switch partition and then leasing control of that partition
    to a third party.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
