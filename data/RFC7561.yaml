abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for achieving end-to-end Quality of Service
    (QoS) in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain where the access network is based
    on IEEE 802.11.  RFC 7222 describes QoS negotiation between a Mobile Access Gateway
    (MAG) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a PMIPv6 mobility domain.  The negotiated
    QoS parameters can be used for QoS policing and marking of packets to enforce
    QoS differentiation on the path between the MAG and LMA.  IEEE 802.11 and Wi-Fi
    Multimedia - Admission Control (WMM-AC) describe methods for QoS negotiation between
    a Wi-Fi Station (MN in PMIPv6 terminology) and an Access Point.  This document
    provides a mapping between the above two sets of QoS procedures and the associated
    QoS parameters.  This document is intended to be used as a companion document
    to RFC 7222 to enable implementation of end-to-end QoS.
