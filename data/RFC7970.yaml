abstract:
  content: The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a data
    representation for security incident reports and indicators commonly exchanged
    by operational security teams for mitigation and watch and warning.  This document
    describes an updated information model for the IODEF and provides an associated
    data model specified with the XML schema.  This new information and data model
    obsoletes RFCs 5070 and 6685.
