abstract:
  content: Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main multimedia
    stream with other multimedia content and delivers the substitutive multimedia
    content to the receivers for a period of time. Splicing is commonly used for insertion
    of local advertisements by cable operators, whereby national advertisement content
    is replaced with a local advertisement. This memo describes some use cases for
    content splicing and a set of requirements for splicing content delivered by RTP.
    It provides concrete guidelines for how an RTP mixer can be used to handle content
    splicing. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
