abstract:
  content: This document describes how to use the 'static-static Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    key-agreement scheme (i.e., Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman where both participants
    use static Diffie-Hellman values) with the Cryptographic Message Syntax.  In this
    form of key agreement, the Diffie-Hellman values of both the sender and receiver
    are long-term values contained in certificates.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
