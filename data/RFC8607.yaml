abstract:
- content: This specification adds an extension to the Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV
    (CalDAV) to allow attachments associated with iCalendar data to be stored and
    managed on the server. This specification documents existing code deployed by
    multiple vendors. It is published as an Informational specification rather than
    Standards Track due to its noncompliance with multiple best current practices
    of HTTP.
