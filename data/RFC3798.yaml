abstract:
  content: This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user agent
    (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message after
    it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.  This content-type is intended
    to be machine-processable.  Additional message headers are also defined to permit
    Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The
    purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other
    messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary "LAN-based" systems, and
    often referred to as "read receipts," "acknowledgements", or "receipt notifications."
    The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often
    been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.  Because many
    messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400
    or the proprietary "LAN-based" systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful
    in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol described
    in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses, in addition to
    those normally used in Internet Mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined
    to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
