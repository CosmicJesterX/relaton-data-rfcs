abstract:
  content: This document specifies a point-to-point route discovery mechanism, complementary
    to the Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) core functionality.  This
    mechanism allows an IPv6 router to discover "on demand" routes to one or more
    IPv6 routers in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) such that the discovered routes
    meet specified metrics constraints.
