abstract:
- content: An application server can use the Voluntary Application Server Identification
    (VAPID) method described in this document to voluntarily identify itself to a
    push service.  The "vapid" authentication scheme allows a client to include its
    identity in a signed token with requests that it makes.  The signature can be
    used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application
    server to a single entity.  The identification information can allow the operator
    of a push service to contact the operator of the application server.  The signature
    can be used to restrict the use of a push message subscription to a single application
    server.
