abstract:
- content: This document defines the conceptual state machines for the Protocol for
    Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA).  The state machines consist
    of the PANA Client (PaC) state machine and the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA)
    state machine.  The two state machines show how PANA can interface with the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP) state machines.  The state machines and associated
    models are informative only.  Implementations may achieve the same results using
    different methods.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
