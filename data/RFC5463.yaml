abstract:
  content: This document describes the "ihave" extension to the Sieve email filtering
    language.  The "ihave" extension provides a means to write scripts that can take
    advantage of optional Sieve features but can still run when those optional features
    are not available.  The extension also defines a new error control command intended
    to be used to report situations where no combination of available extensions satisfies
    the needs of the script. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
