abstract:
- content: This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for providing
    a point-to-multipoint pseudowire (PW) over MPLS Packet Switched Networks.  The
    requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling,
    and maintenance aspects of point-to-multipoint PW operation.  They are proposed
    as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms.  Among other potential
    applications, point-to-multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast
    Layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast Service).
