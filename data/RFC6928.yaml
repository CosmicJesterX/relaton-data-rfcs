abstract:
  content: This document proposes an experiment to increase the permitted TCP initial
    window (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390, to 10 segments
    with a fallback to the existing recommendation when performance issues are detected.  It
    discusses the motivation behind the increase, the advantages and disadvantages
    of the higher initial window, and presents results from several large-scale experiments
    showing that the higher initial window improves the overall performance of many
    web services without resulting in a congestion collapse.  The document closes
    with a discussion of usage and deployment for further experimental purposes recommended
    by the IETF TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM) working group.
