abstract:
- content: Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches currently
    learn the mapping between MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and their egress
    TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or by the TRILL
    ESADI (End-Station Address Distribution Information) protocol. When an ingress
    TRILL switch receives a data frame for a destination address (MAC&Label) that
    the switch does not know, the data frame is flooded within the frame's Data Label
    across the TRILL campus. This document describes the framework for using directory
    services to assist edge TRILL switches in reducing multi-destination frames, particularly
    unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND (Address Resolution Protocol / Neighbor
    Discovery), thus improving TRILL network scalability and security.
