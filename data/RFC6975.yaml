abstract:
- content: The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication
    and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital
    signatures can be generated using different algorithms.  This document specifies
    a way for validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server which digital
    signature and hash algorithms they support.  The extensions allow the signaling
    of new algorithm uptake in client code to allow zone administrators to know when
    it is possible to complete an algorithm rollover in a DNSSEC-signed zone.
