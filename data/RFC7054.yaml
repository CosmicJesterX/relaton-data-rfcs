abstract:
- content: The framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) within
    the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how the Maintenance Entity Group
    Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at incoming and
    outgoing interfaces. This document elaborates on important considerations for
    internal MIP addressing. More precisely, it describes important restrictions for
    any mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that they can be
    targeted at MIPs on either incoming or outgoing interfaces and forwarded correctly
    through the forwarding engine. Furthermore, the document includes considerations
    for node implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming and
    outgoing MIP.
