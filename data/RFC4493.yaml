abstract:
  content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently
    specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), which is equivalent
    to the One-Key CBC MAC1 (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.  This memo specifies
    an authentication algorithm based on CMAC with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES).  This new authentication algorithm is named AES-CMAC.  The purpose
    of this document is to make the AES-CMAC algorithm conveniently available to the
    Internet Community.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
