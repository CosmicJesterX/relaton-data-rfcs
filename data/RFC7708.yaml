abstract:
  content: The Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) protocol specified
    in RFC 5085 provides a control channel (CC) that is associated with a pseudowire
    (PW).  This document specifies an additional VCCV control channel type to be used
    with pseudowires that do not use the PW Control Word and that are carried over
    an MPLS network.  This new VCCV CC type uses the Generic Associated Channel Label
    defined in RFC 5586 to distinguish VCCV packets from packets carrying user data.  This
    new VCCV CC type introduces compatibility with the method of MPLS Label Switched
    Path Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) identification, particularly
    in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks (RFC 5921).
