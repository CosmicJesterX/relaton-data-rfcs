abstract:
  content: 'This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can remain
    valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to its validity even if the
    signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (i.e., repudiates) the validity
    of the signature. The format can be considered as an extension to RFC 3852 and
    RFC 2634, where, when appropriate, additional signed and unsigned attributes have
    been defined. The contents of this Informational RFC amount to a transposition
    of the ETSI Technical Specification (TS) 101 733 V.1.7.4 (CMS Advanced Electronic
    Signatures -- CAdES) and is technically equivalent to it. The technical contents
    of this specification are maintained by ETSI. The ETSI TS and further updates
    are available free of charge at: http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Standards/StandardsDownload.aspx
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.'
