abstract:
- content: This RFC proposes a set of extensions to the TCP protocol to provide efficient
    operation over a path with a high bandwidth*delay product.  These extensions are
    not proposed as an Internet standard at this time.  Instead, they are intended
    as a basis for further experimentation and research on transport protocol performance.
