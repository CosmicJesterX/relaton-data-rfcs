abstract:
  content: The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication
    and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital
    signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust
    anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies
    a mechanism that will allow an end user and third parties to determine the trusted
    key state for the root key of the resolvers that handle that user's DNS queries.  Note
    that this method is only applicable for determining which keys are in the trust
    store for the root key.
