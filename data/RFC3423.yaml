abstract:
- content: This document defines the Common Reliable Accounting for Network Element
    (CRANE) protocol that enables efficient and reliable delivery of any data, mainly
    accounting data from Network Elements to any systems, such as mediation systems
    and Business Support Systems (BSS)/ Operations Support Systems (OSS).  The protocol
    is developed to address the critical needs for exporting high volume of accounting
    data from NE's with efficient use of network, storage, and processing resources.  This
    document specifies the architecture of the protocol and the message format, which
    MUST be supported by all CRANE protocol implementations.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
