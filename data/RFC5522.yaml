abstract:
  content: This document describes the requirements and desired properties of Network
    Mobility (NEMO) Route Optimization techniques for use in global-networked communications
    systems for aeronautics and space exploration. Substantial input to these requirements
    was given by aeronautical communications experts outside the IETF, including members
    of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other aeronautical
    communications standards bodies. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
