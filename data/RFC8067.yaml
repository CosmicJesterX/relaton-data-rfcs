abstract:
  content: RFC 3967 specifies a process for allowing normative references to documents
    at lower maturity levels ("downrefs"), which involves calling out the downref
    explicitly in the Last Call notice.  That requirement has proven to be unnecessarily
    strict, and this document updates RFC 3967, allowing the IESG more flexibility
    in accepting downrefs in Standards Track documents.
