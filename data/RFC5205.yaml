abstract:
- content: This document specifies a new resource record (RR) for the Domain Name
    System (DNS), and how to use it with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  This RR
    allows a HIP node to store in the DNS its Host Identity (HI, the public component
    of the node public-private key pair), Host Identity Tag (HIT, a truncated hash
    of its public key), and the Domain Names of its rendezvous servers (RVSs).  This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
