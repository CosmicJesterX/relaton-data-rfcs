abstract:
- content: This document presents a list of tests for implementers of IP Flow Information
    eXport (IPFIX) compliant Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.  This document
    specifies guidelines for a series of tests that can be run on the IPFIX Exporting
    Process and Collecting Process in order to probe the conformity and robustness
    of the IPFIX protocol implementations.  These tests cover all important functions,
    in order to gain a level of confidence in the IPFIX implementation.  Therefore,
    they allow the implementer to perform interoperability or plug tests with other
    IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
