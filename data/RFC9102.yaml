abstract:
  content: This document describes an experimental TLS extension for the in-band transport
    of the complete set of records that can be validated by DNSSEC and that are needed
    to perform DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) of a TLS server.
    This extension obviates the need to perform separate, out-of-band DNS lookups.
    When the requisite DNS records do not exist, the extension conveys a denial-of-existence
    proof that can be validated. This experimental extension is developed outside
    the IETF and is published here to guide implementation of the extension and to
    ensure interoperability among implementations.
