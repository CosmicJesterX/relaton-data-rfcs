abstract:
- content: In many applications where different nodes cooperate on some work, there
    is a need to guarantee that the work happens atomically.  That is, each node must
    reach the same conclusion as to whether the work is to be completed, even in the
    face of failures.  This document proposes a simple, easily-implemented protocol
    for achieving this end. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
