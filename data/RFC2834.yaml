abstract:
  content: This document specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to ANSI High-Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI) hardware addresses and for emulating IP broadcast in
    a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension of HARP (hardware addresses).  This
    memo defines a HARP that will interoperate between HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 (also
    known as Gigabyte System Network, GSN).  This document (when combined with RFC
    2067 "IP over HIPPI") obsoletes RFC 1374. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
