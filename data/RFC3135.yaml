abstract:
  content: This document is a survey of Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) often
    employed to improve degraded TCP performance caused by characteristics of specific
    link environments, for example, in satellite, wireless WAN, and wireless LAN environments.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
