abstract:
- content: This document introduces VRRP-aware PIM, a redundancy mechanism for the
    Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) to interoperate with the Virtual Router Redundancy
    Protocol (VRRP).  It allows PIM to track VRRP state and to preserve multicast
    traffic upon failover in a redundant network with virtual routing groups enabled.  The
    mechanism described in this document is based on Cisco IOS software implementation.
