abstract:
- content: This memo discusses subnets and proposes procedures for the use of subnets,
    including approaches to solving the problems that arise, particularly that of
    routing.  A subnet of an Internet network is a logically visible sub-section of
    a single Internet network.  For administrative or technical reasons, many organizations
    have chosen to divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring
    a set of Internet network numbers.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for
    the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
