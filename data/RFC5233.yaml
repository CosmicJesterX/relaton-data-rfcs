abstract:
  content: On email systems that allow for 'subaddressing' or 'detailed addressing'
    (e.g., "ken+sieve@example.org"), it is sometimes desirable to make comparisons
    against these sub-parts of addresses.  This document defines an extension to the
    Sieve Email Filtering Language that allows users to compare against the user and
    detail sub-parts of an address. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
