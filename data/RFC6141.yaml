abstract:
  content: The procedures for handling SIP re-INVITEs are described in RFC 3261.  Implementation
    and deployment experience has uncovered a number of issues with the original documentation,
    and this document provides additional procedures that update the original specification
    to address those issues.  In particular, this document defines in which situations
    a UAS (User Agent Server) should generate a success response and in which situations
    a UAS should generate an error response to a re-INVITE.  Additionally, this document
    defines further details of procedures related to target-refresh requests. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
