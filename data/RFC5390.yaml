abstract:
  content: Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when proxies
    and user agents have insufficient resources to complete the processing of a request.  SIP
    provides limited support for overload handling through its 503 response code,
    which tells an upstream element that it is overloaded.  However, numerous problems
    have been identified with this mechanism.  This document summarizes the problems
    with the existing 503 mechanism, and provides some requirements for a solution.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
