abstract:
  content: Implementation of generators and parsers of header fields requires certain
    information about those fields.  Interoperability is most likely when all such
    information is explicitly provided by the technical specification of the fields.  Lacking
    such explicit information, implementers may guess, and interoperability may suffer.  This
    memo identifies information useful to implementers of header field generators
    and parsers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
