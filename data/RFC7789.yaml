abstract:
- content: This document describes how unexpected traffic flows can emerge across
    an autonomous system as the result of other autonomous systems filtering or restricting
    the propagation of more-specific prefixes.  We provide a review of the techniques
    to detect the occurrence of this issue and defend against it.
