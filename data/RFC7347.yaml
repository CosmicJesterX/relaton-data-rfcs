abstract:
  content: The IETF Standards Track solution for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    Linear Protection is provided in RFCs 6378, 7271, and 7324. This document describes
    the pre-standard implementation of MPLS-TP Linear Protection that has been deployed
    by several network operators using equipment from multiple vendors. At the time
    of publication, these pre-standard implementations were still in operation carrying
    live traffic. The specified mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional/bidirectional
    protection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching. It is purely
    supported by the MPLS-TP data plane and can work without any control plane.
