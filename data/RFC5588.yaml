abstract:
- content: This document defines a new function for the Generic Security Service Application
    Program Interface (GSS-API), which allows applications to store delegated (and
    other) credentials in the implicit GSS-API credential store.  This is needed for
    GSS-API applications to use delegated credentials as they would use other credentials.
