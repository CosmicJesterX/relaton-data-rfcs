abstract:
  content: This document describes a framework comprised of a number of scenarios
    and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) redundancy.  A set of redundant
    PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in single-segment PW applications
    or between terminating PE (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment PW applications.  In order
    for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets
    to one another, a new PW status is required to indicate the preferential forwarding
    status of active or standby for each PW in the redundant set.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
