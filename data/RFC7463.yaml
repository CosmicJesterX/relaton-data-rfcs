abstract:
  content: This document describes the requirements and implementation of a group
    telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple
    Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA).  When implemented
    using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances
    of an Address of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This
    feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP Private Branch Exchange
    (IPBX) offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP
    feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature allows several user
    agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about calls placed and received by other
    UAs in the group, and pick up or join calls within the group.  This document discusses
    use cases, lists requirements, and defines extensions to implement this feature.  This
    specification updates RFCs 3261 and 4235.
