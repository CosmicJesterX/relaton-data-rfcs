abstract:
  content: In order to improve the readability of RFCs while supporting their archivability,
    the canonical format of the RFC Series will be transitioning from plain-text ASCII
    to XML using the xml2rfc version 3 vocabulary; different publication formats will
    be rendered from that base document.  With these changes comes an increase in
    complexity for authors, consumers, and the publisher of RFCs.  This document serves
    as the framework that provides the problem statement, lays out a road map of the
    documents that capture the specific requirements, and describes the transition
    plan.
