abstract:
  content: 'This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check value
    from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity check
    value from an Elliptic Curve key pair. This behavior is needed for such operations
    as creating the signature of a Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #10 Certification
    Request. These algorithms are designed to provide a Proof-of-Possession of the
    private key and not to be a general purpose signing algorithm. This document obsoletes
    RFC 2875.'
