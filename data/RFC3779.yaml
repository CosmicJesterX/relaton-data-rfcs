abstract:
  content: This document defines two X.509 v3 certificate extensions.  The first binds
    a list of IP address blocks, or prefixes, to the subject of a certificate.  The
    second binds a list of autonomous system identifiers to the subject of a certificate.  These
    extensions may be used to convey the authorization of the subject to use the IP
    addresses and autonomous system identifiers contained in the extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
