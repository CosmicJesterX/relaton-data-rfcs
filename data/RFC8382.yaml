abstract:
- content: This document describes a mechanism to detect whether end-to-end data flows
    share a common bottleneck.  This mechanism relies on summary statistics that are
    calculated based on continuous measurements and used as input to a grouping algorithm
    that runs wherever the knowledge is needed.
