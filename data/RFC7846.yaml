abstract:
  content: This document specifies the base Peer-to-Peer Streaming Tracker Protocol
    (PPSTP) version 1, an application-layer control (signaling) protocol for the exchange
    of meta information between trackers and peers.  The specification outlines the
    architecture of the protocol and its functionality; it also describes message
    flows, message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax, and semantics.  The
    PPSTP enables cooperating peers to form content-streaming overlay networks to
    support near real-time delivery of structured media content (audio, video, and
    associated timed text and metadata), such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable),
    and multi-view (3D) videos in live, time-shifted, and on-demand modes.
