abstract:
- content: Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) is a markup language used
    in conjunction with SIP to provide advanced conferencing and interactive voice
    response (IVR) functions.  MSCML presents an application-level control model,
    as opposed to device-level control models.  One use of this protocol is for communications
    between a conference focus and mixer in the IETF SIP Conferencing Framework.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
