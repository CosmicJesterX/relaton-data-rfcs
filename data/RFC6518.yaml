abstract:
  content: This document is one of a series concerned with defining a roadmap of protocol
    specification work for the use of modern cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms
    for message authentication in routing protocols.  In particular, it defines the
    framework for a key management protocol that may be used to create and manage
    session keys for message authentication and integrity.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
