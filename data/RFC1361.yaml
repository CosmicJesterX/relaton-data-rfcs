abstract:
  content: This memorandum describes the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP), which
    is an adaptation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) used to synchronize computer
    clocks in the Internet.  This memorandum does not obsolete or update any RFC.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an
    Internet standard.  Discussion of the standardization process and the RFC document
    series is presented first, followed by an explanation of the terms.  Sections
    6.2 - 6.9 contain the lists of protocols in each stage of standardization.  Finally
    come pointers to references and contacts for further information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
