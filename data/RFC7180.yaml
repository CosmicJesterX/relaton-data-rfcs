abstract:
  content: The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol
    provides least-cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topology and link technology, safe forwarding even during
    periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast
    traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) link-state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header
    that includes a hop count. Since publication of the TRILL base protocol in July
    2011, active development of TRILL has revealed errata in RFC 6325 and some cases
    that could use clarifications or updates. RFCs 6327 and 6439 provide clarifications
    and updates with respect to adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document
    provides other known clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFCs 6325, 6327,
    and 6439.
