abstract:
- content: This document describes a mechanism that allows a system to originate more
    than 256 Link State PDU (LSP) fragments, a limit set by the original Intermediate
    System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing protocol, as described in ISO/IEC
    10589.  This mechanism can be used in IP-only, OSI-only, and dual routers.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
