abstract:
  content: Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications environments
    such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of these environments, all
    calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording
    of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a recording
    device.  This document describes architectures for deploying session recording
    solutions in an environment that is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
