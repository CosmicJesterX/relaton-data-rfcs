abstract:
  content: Rules for validating identifier labels and alternate representations of
    those labels (variants) are known as Label Generation Rulesets (LGRs); they are
    used for the implementation of identifier systems such as Internationalized Domain
    Names (IDNs).  This document describes ways to design LGRs to support variant
    labels.  In designing LGRs, it is important to ensure that the label generation
    rules are consistent and well behaved in the presence of variants.  The design
    decisions can then be expressed using the XML representation of LGRs that is defined
    in RFC 7940.
