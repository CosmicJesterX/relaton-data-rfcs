abstract:
- content: This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block to be
    used as Shared Address Space to accommodate the needs of Carrier- Grade NAT (CGN)
    devices. It is anticipated that Service Providers will use this Shared Address
    Space to number the interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premises Equipment
    (CPE). Shared Address Space is distinct from RFC 1918 private address space because
    it is intended for use on Service Provider networks. However, it may be used in
    a manner similar to RFC 1918 private address space on routing equipment that is
    able to do address translation across router interfaces when the addresses are
    identical on two different interfaces. Details are provided in the text of this
    document. This document details the allocation of an additional special-use IPv4
    address block and updates RFC 5735. This memo documents an Internet Best Current
    Practice.
