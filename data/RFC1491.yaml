abstract:
  content: This document is the result of a survey asking people to detail their advanced
    usages of X.500.  It is intended to show how various organizations are using X.500
    in ways which extend the view of X.500 as a "White Pages" service.  This RFC is
    a product of the Integrated Directory Services Working Group of the Application
    and User Services Areas of the IETF.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
