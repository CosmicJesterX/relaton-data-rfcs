abstract:
- content: This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored to advance
    deployment of IPv6 to end users via a service provider's IPv4 network infrastructure.  Key
    aspects include automatic IPv6 prefix delegation to sites, stateless operation,
    simple provisioning, and service, which is equivalent to native IPv6 at the sites
    that are served by the mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
