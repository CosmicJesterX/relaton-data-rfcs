abstract:
- content: Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the Internet
    via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of little interest
    to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing these local complexes of links
    is to use the same strategy as the Internet uses to organize networks, that is,
    to declare each link to be an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the
    links with devices that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general
    scheme is called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the
    connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).  This RFC
    discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted environments in the ARPA-Internet.
