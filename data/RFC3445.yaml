abstract:
- content: This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record (RR)
    to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  The
    original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary application
    keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the same record type is a
    mistake.  This document removes application keys from the KEY record by redefining
    the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  As a result of removing application
    keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become unnecessary and are redefined.  Three
    existing application key sub-types are changed to reserved, but the format of
    the KEY record is not changed.  This document updates RFC 2535. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
