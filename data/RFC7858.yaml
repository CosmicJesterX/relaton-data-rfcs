abstract:
- content: This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide
    privacy for DNS. Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping
    and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC
    7626. In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over TLS
    and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using
    TCP and TLS with DNS. This document focuses on securing stub-to-recursive traffic,
    as per the charter of the DPRIVE Working Group. It does not prevent future applications
    of the protocol to recursive-to-authoritative traffic.
