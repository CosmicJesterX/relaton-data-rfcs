abstract:
  content: Routers interact with numerous network infrastructure servers, including
    DNS and SNMP.  These interactions, not just the pure addressing and routing structure,
    must be considered as part of router renumbering.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.
