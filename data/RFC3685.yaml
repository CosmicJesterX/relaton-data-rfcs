abstract:
  content: The SIEVE mail filtering language "spamtest" and "virustest" extensions
    permit users to use simple, portable commands for spam and virus tests on email
    messages.  Each extension provides a new test using matches against numeric 'scores'.  It
    is the responsibility of the underlying SIEVE implementation to do the actual
    checks that result in values returned by the tests. [PROPOSED STANDARD]
