abstract:
- content: 'RSVP-TE provides support for the communication of exclusion information
    during Label Switched Path (LSP) setup. A typical LSP diversity use case is for
    protection, where two LSPs should follow different paths through the network in
    order to avoid single points of failure, thus greatly improving service availability.
    This document specifies an approach that can be used for network scenarios where
    the full path(s) is not necessarily known by use of an abstract identifier for
    the path. Three types of abstract identifiers are specified: client based, Path
    Computation Element (PCE) based, and network based. This document specifies two
    new diversity subobjects for the RSVP eXclude Route Object (XRO) and the Explicit
    Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS). For the protection use case, LSPs are typically
    created at a slow rate and exist for a long time so that it is reasonable to assume
    that a given (reference) path currently existing (with a well-known identifier)
    will continue to exist and can be used as a reference when creating the new diverse
    path. Re-routing of the existing (reference) LSP, before the new path is established,
    is not considered.'
