abstract:
  content: A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not only the information
    disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) but also the set
    of active paths and their reserved resources for its computation.  The additional
    Label Switched Path (LSP) state information allows the PCE to compute constrained
    paths while considering individual LSPs and their interactions.  This requires
    a State Synchronization mechanism between the PCE and the network, the PCE and
    Path Computation Clients (PCCs), and cooperating PCEs.  The basic mechanism for
    State Synchronization is part of the stateful PCE specification.  This document
    presents motivations for optimizations to the base State Synchronization procedure
    and specifies the required Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    extensions.
