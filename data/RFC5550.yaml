abstract:
  content: This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, restrictions,
    and usage modes), dubbed Lemonade, of the IMAP, mail submission, and Sieve protocols.
    This profile allows clients (especially those that are constrained in memory,
    bandwidth, processing power, or other areas) to efficiently use IMAP and Submission
    to access and submit mail. This includes the ability to forward received mail
    without needing to download and upload the mail, to optimize submission, and to
    efficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the server. The
    Lemonade Profile relies upon several extensions to IMAP, Sieve, and Mail Submission
    protocols. The document also defines a new IMAP extension and registers several
    new IMAP keywords. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
