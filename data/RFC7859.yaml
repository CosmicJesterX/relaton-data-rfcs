abstract:
  content: This document extends RFC 7182, which specifies a framework for (and specific
    examples of) Integrity Check Values (ICVs) for packets and messages using the
    generalized packet/message format specified in RFC 5444.  It does so by defining
    an additional cryptographic function that allows the creation of an ICV that is
    an Identity-Based Signature (IBS), defined according to the Elliptic Curve-Based
    Certificateless Signatures for Identity-Based Encryption (ECCSI) algorithm specified
    in RFC 6507.
