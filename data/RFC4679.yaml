abstract:
  content: This document describes the set of Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
    Vendor-Specific Attributes (RADIUS VSAs) defined by the DSL Forum. These attributes
    are designed to transport Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) information that is not
    supported by the standard RADIUS attribute set. It is expected that this document
    will be updated if and when the DSL Forum defines additional vendor-specific attributes,
    since its primary purpose is to provide a reference for DSL equipment vendors
    wishing to interoperate with other vendors' products. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
