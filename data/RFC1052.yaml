abstract:
  content: This RFC is intended to convey to the Internet community and other interested
    parties the recommendations of the Internet Activities Board (IAB) for the development
    of network management protocols for use in the TCP/IP environment.  This memo
    does NOT, in and of itself, define or propose an Official Internet Protocol.  It
    does reflect, however, the policy of the IAB with respect to further network management
    development in the short and long term.
