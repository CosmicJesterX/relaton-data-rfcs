abstract:
- content: The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.  In
    this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere
    of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area
    or an Autonomous Systems.  This document specifies a procedure relying on the
    use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute such inter-domain
    shortest constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains, using a
    backward-recursive path computation technique.  This technique preserves confidentiality
    across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different
    service providers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
