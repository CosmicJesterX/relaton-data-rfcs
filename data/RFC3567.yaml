abstract:
  content: This document describes the authentication of Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) using the Hashed Message Authentication
    Codes - Message Digest 5 (HMAC-MD5) algorithm as found in RFC 2104.  IS-IS is
    specified in International Standards Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions
    to support Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195.  The base
    specification includes an authentication mechanism that allows for multiple authentication
    algorithms.  The base specification only specifies the algorithm for cleartext
    passwords.  This document proposes an extension to that specification that allows
    the use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in conjunction with
    the existing authentication mechanisms.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
