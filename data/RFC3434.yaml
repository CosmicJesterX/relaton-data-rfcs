abstract:
  content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it describes managed objects for extending the alarm thresholding capabilities
    found in the Remote Monitoring (RMON) MIB (RFC 2819), to provide similar threshold
    monitoring of objects based on the Counter64 data type. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
