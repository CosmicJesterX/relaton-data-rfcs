abstract:
- content: This document is being published primarily for historical context and comparative
    purposes, essentially to document some thoughts about how 1591 might have been
    interpreted and adjusted by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and
    ICANN to better reflect today's world while retaining characteristics and policies
    that have proven to be effective in supporting Internet growth and stability.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
