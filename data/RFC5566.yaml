abstract:
  content: The BGP Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) provides
    a method for the dynamic exchange of encapsulation information and for the indication
    of encapsulation protocol types to be used for different next hops.  Currently,
    support for Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TPv3),
    and IP in IP tunnel types are defined.  This document defines support for IPsec
    tunnel types. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
