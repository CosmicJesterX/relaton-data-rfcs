abstract:
  content: IPv6 prefix length, as in IPv4, is a parameter conveyed and used in IPv6
    routing and forwarding processes in accordance with the Classless Inter-domain
    Routing (CIDR) architecture.  The length of an IPv6 prefix may be any number from
    zero to 128, although subnets using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    for address allocation conventionally use a /64 prefix.  Hardware and software
    implementations of routing and forwarding should therefore impose no rules on
    prefix length, but implement longest-match-first on prefixes of any valid length.
