abstract:
  content: This document specifies extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
    to facilitate Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  The extensions are
    based on the use of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology
    to discover a working path between two end-hosts, and on standard techniques for
    encapsulating Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets within the User Datagram
    Protocol (UDP).  This document also defines elements of a procedure for NAT traversal,
    including the optional use of a HIP relay server.  With these extensions HIP is
    able to work in environments that have NATs and provides a generic NAT traversal
    solution to higher-layer networking applications.  This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.
