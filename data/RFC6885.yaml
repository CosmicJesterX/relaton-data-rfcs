abstract:
  content: If a protocol expects to compare two strings and is prepared only for those
    strings to be ASCII, then using Unicode code points in those strings requires
    they be prepared somehow.  Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (here
    called IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.  Other protocols subsequently
    defined Stringprep profiles.  A new approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep
    is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles
    need to be similarly updated, or a replacement of Stringprep needs to be designed.  This
    document outlines the issues to be faced by those designing a Stringprep replacement.
