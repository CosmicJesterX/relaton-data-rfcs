abstract:
  content: 'This document specifies the core of the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)
    Callout Protocol (OCP).  OCP marshals application messages from other communication
    protocols: An OPES intermediary sends original application messages to a callout
    server; the callout server sends adapted application messages back to the processor.  OCP
    is designed with typical adaptation tasks in mind (e.g., virus and spam management,
    language and format translation, message anonymization, or advertisement manipulation).  As
    defined in this document, the OCP Core consists of application-agnostic mechanisms
    essential for efficient support of typical adaptations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
