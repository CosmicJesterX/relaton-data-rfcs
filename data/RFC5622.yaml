abstract:
- content: This document specifies a profile for Congestion Control Identifier 4,
    the small-packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses
    TFRC-SP (RFC 4828), a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small
    packets.  CCID 4 is considered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental,
    and is not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at this time.  The
    goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second (bps)
    as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level
    of congestion.  CCID 4 is for use for senders that send small packets and would
    like a TCP- friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.
