abstract:
  content: This document describes an envelope that can be used to bind a file (not
    necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) with one or more time-stamp
    tokens obtained for that file, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined
    in RFC 3161 or its successors. Additional types of temporal evidence are also
    allowed. The proposed envelope is based on the Cryptographic Message Syntax as
    defined in RFC 5652. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
