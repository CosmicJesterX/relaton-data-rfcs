abstract:
  content: This memo obsoletes RFC 2793; it describes how to carry real-time text
    conversation session contents in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents
    are specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.140. One payload format is described for
    transmitting text on a separate RTP session dedicated for the transmission of
    text. This RTP payload description recommends a method to include redundant text
    from already transmitted packets in order to reduce the risk of text loss caused
    by packet loss. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
