abstract:
  content: This document describes lightweight IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols (LW- IGMPv3
    and LW-MLDv2), which simplify the standard (full) versions of IGMPv3 and MLDv2.  The
    interoperability with the full versions and the previous versions of IGMP and
    MLD is also taken into account. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
