abstract:
  content: This document specifies the SIP P-Served-User P-header.  This header field
    addresses an issue that was found in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
    IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) between an S-CSCF (Serving Call Session Control
    Function) and an AS (Application Server) on the ISC (IMS Service Control) interface.  This
    header field conveys the identity of the served user and the session case that
    applies to this particular communication session and application invocation.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
