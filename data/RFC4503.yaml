abstract:
  content: This document describes the encryption algorithm Rabbit.  It is a stream
    cipher algorithm with a 128-bit key and 64-bit initialization vector (IV).  The
    method was published in 2003 and has been subject to public security and performance
    revision.  Its high performance makes it particularly suited for the use with
    Internet protocols where large amounts of data have to be processed.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
