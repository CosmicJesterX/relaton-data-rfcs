abstract:
  content: This document contains a specification of three YANG modules and one submodule.  Together
    they form the core routing data model that serves as a framework for configuring
    and managing a routing subsystem.  It is expected that these modules will be augmented
    by additional YANG modules defining data models for control-plane protocols, route
    filters, and other functions.  The core routing data model provides common building
    blocks for such extensions -- routes, Routing Information Bases (RIBs), and control-plane
    protocols.
