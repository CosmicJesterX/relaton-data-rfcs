abstract:
  content: Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires a description of
    the logical architecture and standardisation of the key protocols that coordinate
    interactions between the components.  This document presents an overall framework
    for large-scale measurements.  It also defines terminology for LMAP (Large-Scale
    Measurement of Broadband Performance).
