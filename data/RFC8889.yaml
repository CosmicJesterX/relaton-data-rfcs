abstract:
- content: The Alternate-Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can only be applied
    to point-to-point flows, because it assumes that all the packets of the flow measured
    on one node are measured again by a single second node.  This document generalizes
    and expands this methodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose packets
    can follow several different paths in the network -- in wider terms, a multipoint-to-multipoint
    network.  For this reason, the technique here described is called "Multipoint
    Alternate Marking".
