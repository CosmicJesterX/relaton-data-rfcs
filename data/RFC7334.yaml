abstract:
- content: The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across multiple domains has
    been identified as a key requirement for the deployment of P2MP services in MPLS-
    and GMPLS-controlled networks. The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized
    as an appropriate technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP
    TE LSPs. This document describes an experiment to provide procedures and extensions
    to the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) for the computation of inter-domain paths
    for P2MP TE LSPs.
