abstract:
- content: This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path Computation
    Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical
    Networks (WSONs).  Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a Routing and Wavelength
    Assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment
    is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path
    and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light path computation.  Requirements
    for PCEP extensions in support of optical impairments will be addressed in a separate
    document.
