abstract:
  content: This document presents an object-oriented information model for representing
    Quality of Service (QoS) network management policies.  This document is based
    on the IETF Policy Core Information Model and its extensions.  It defines an information
    model for QoS enforcement for differentiated and integrated services using policy.  It
    is important to note that this document defines an information model, which by
    definition is independent of any particular data storage mechanism and access
    protocol.
