abstract:
  content: This document describes the architecture of the eduroam service for federated
    (wireless) network access in academia.  The combination of IEEE 802.1X, the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP), and RADIUS that is used in eduroam provides a secure,
    scalable, and deployable service for roaming network access.  The successful deployment
    of eduroam over the last decade in the educational sector may serve as an example
    for other sectors, hence this document.  In particular, the initial architectural
    choices and selection of standards are described, along with the changes that
    were prompted by operational experience.
