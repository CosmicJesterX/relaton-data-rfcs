abstract:
- content: This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  The Password
    Generator Service (PWDGEN) provides a set of six randomly generated eight-character
    "words" with a reasonable level of pronounceability, using a multi-level algorithm.  Hosts
    on the ARPA Internet that choose to implement a password generator service are
    expected to adopt and implement this standard.
