abstract:
  content: The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in multimedia
    telephony applications.  These applications are typically required to implement
    congestion control.  This document describes the test cases to be used in the
    performance evaluation of such congestion control algorithms in a controlled environment.
