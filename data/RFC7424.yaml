abstract:
- content: Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially due to bandwidth-hungry
    applications such as rich media applications and inter-data-center communications.  In
    this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks
    that extensively use link aggregation groups and equal-cost multipaths as techniques
    for bandwidth scaling.  This document explores some of the mechanisms useful for
    achieving this.
