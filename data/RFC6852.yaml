abstract:
  content: On 29 August 2012, the leaders of the IEEE Standards Association, the IAB,
    the IETF, the Internet Society, and the W3C signed a statement affirming the importance
    of a jointly developed set of principles establishing a modern paradigm for global,
    open standards.  These principles have become known as the "OpenStand" principles.  This
    document contains the text of the affirmation that was signed.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
