abstract:
  content: This document describes mechanisms for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay diagnostics.  It
    defines extensions to the REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) base protocol
    to collect diagnostic information and details the protocol specifications for
    these extensions.  Useful diagnostic information for connection and node status
    monitoring is also defined.  The document also describes the usage scenarios and
    provides examples of how these methods are used to perform diagnostics.
