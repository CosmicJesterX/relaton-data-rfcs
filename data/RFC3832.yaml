abstract:
- content: Remote service discovery refers to discovering desired services in given
    remote (i.e., non-local) DNS domains.  This document describes remote service
    discovery in the Service Location Protocol (SLP) via DNS SRV.  It defines the
    DNS SRV Resource Records for SLP Directory Agent services, discusses various issues
    in using SLP and DNS SRV together for remote service discovery, and gives the
    steps for discovering desired services in remote DNS domains.  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
