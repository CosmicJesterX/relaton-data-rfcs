abstract:
- content: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a flexible yet simple tool for
    establishing interactive communications sessions across the Internet.  Part of
    this flexibility is the ease with which it can be extended.  In order to facilitate
    effective and interoperable extensions to SIP, some guidelines need to be followed
    when developing SIP extensions.  This document outlines a set of such guidelines
    for authors of SIP extensions.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
