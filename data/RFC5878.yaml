abstract:
  content: This document specifies authorization extensions to the Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol.  Extensions are carried in the client and server
    hello messages to confirm that both parties support the desired authorization
    data types.  Then, if supported by both the client and the server, authorization
    information, such as attribute certificates (ACs) or Security Assertion Markup
    Language (SAML) assertions, is exchanged in the supplemental data handshake message.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
