abstract:
  content: The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of new
    applications for the technology (e.g., data center interconnect) have culminated
    in a new set of requirements that are not readily addressable by the current Virtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution.  In particular, multihoming with all-active
    forwarding is not supported, and there's no existing solution to leverage Multipoint-to-Multipoint
    (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for optimizing the delivery of multi-destination
    frames.  Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even in the context of BGP-based
    auto-discovery, requires network operators to specify various network parameters
    on top of the access configuration.  This document specifies the requirements
    for an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solution, which addresses the above issues.
