abstract:
  content: Cisco's Service-Level Assurance Protocol (Cisco's SLA Protocol) is a Performance

    loss.  This document describes the Cisco SLA Protocol Measurement-Type UDP-Measurement,
    to enable vendor interoperability.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
