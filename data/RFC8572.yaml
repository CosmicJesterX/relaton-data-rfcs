abstract:
  content: This document presents a technique to securely provision a networking device
    when it is booting in a factory-default state.  Variations in the solution enable
    it to be used on both public and private networks.  The provisioning steps are
    able to update the boot image, commit an initial configuration, and execute arbitrary
    scripts to address auxiliary needs.  The updated device is subsequently able to
    establish secure connections with other systems.  For instance, a device may establish
    NETCONF (RFC 6241) and/or RESTCONF (RFC 8040) connections with deployment-specific
    network management systems.
