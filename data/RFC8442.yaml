abstract:
  content: This document defines several new cipher suites for version 1.2 of the
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  These cipher suites are based on the Ephemeral
    Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with Pre-Shared Key (ECDHE_PSK) key exchange together
    with the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms AES-GCM
    and AES-CCM.  PSK provides light and efficient authentication, ECDHE provides
    forward secrecy, and AES-GCM and AES-CCM provide encryption and integrity protection.
