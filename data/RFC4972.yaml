abstract:
- content: The setup of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
    Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers
    (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth
    optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.  Such
    deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs
    (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).  This document specifies Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic
    discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation
    of such mesh of TE LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
