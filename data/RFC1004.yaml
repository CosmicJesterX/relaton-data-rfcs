abstract:
  content: The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on authentication problems
    in the Internet and possible methods of solution.  The proposed solutions this
    document are not intended as standards for the Internet at this time.  Rather,
    it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution
    to authentication problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards.  This
    document suggests mediated access-control and authentication procedures suitable
    for those cases when an association is to be set up between users belonging to
    different trust environments.
