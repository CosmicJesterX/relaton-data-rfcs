abstract:
  content: This document describes a data representation for collections of DNS messages.  The
    format is designed for efficient storage and transmission of large packet captures
    of DNS traffic; it attempts to minimize the size of such packet capture files
    but retain the full DNS message contents along with the most useful transport
    metadata.  It is intended to assist with the development of DNS traffic- monitoring
    applications.
