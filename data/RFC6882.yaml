abstract:
- content: IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sites across
    an IP/MPLS backbone. These VPNs can be operated using BGP/MPLS, and a single Provider
    Edge (PE) node may provide access to multiple customer sites belonging to different
    VPNs. The VPNs may support a number of customer services, including RSVP and Resource
    Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) traffic. This document describes
    how to support RSVP-TE between customer sites when a single PE supports multiple
    VPNs and labels are not used to identify VPNs between PEs.
