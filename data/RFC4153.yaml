abstract:
  content: This document specifies rules for defining voucher properties in XML syntax.  A
    voucher is a logical entity that represents a right to claim goods or services.  A
    voucher can be used to transfer a wide range of electronic values, including coupons,
    tickets, loyalty points, and gift certificates, which often have to be processed
    in the course of payment and/or delivery transactions.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
