abstract:
  content: This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps. The Feature-Caps
    header field conveys feature-capability indicators that are used to indicate support
    of features and capabilities for SIP entities that are not represented by the
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the Contact header field. SIP entities that
    are represented by the URI of the SIP Contact header field can convey media feature
    tags in the Contact header field to indicate support of features and capabilities.
    This specification also defines feature-capability indicators and creates a new
    IANA registry, "Proxy-Feature Feature-Capability Indicator Trees", for registering
    feature-capability indicators. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
