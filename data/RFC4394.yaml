abstract:
- content: The Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been developed as part of the Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic Engineering (TE) resources and links.  The
    GMPLS control plane (routing and signaling) uses TE links for establishing Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs).  This memo describes the relationship of the LMP procedures
    to 'discovery' as defined in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T),
    and ongoing ITU-T work.  This document provides an overview of LMP in the context
    of the ITU-T Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) and transport network
    terminology and relates it to the ITU-T discovery work to promote a common understanding
    for progressing the work of IETF and ITU-T.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.
