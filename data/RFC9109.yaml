abstract:
  content: The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can operate in several modes.  Some of
    these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets and therefore require
    the use of a well-known port as the local port.  However, in the case of NTP modes
    where the use of a well-known port is not required, employing such a well-known
    port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path
    attacks.  This document formally updates RFC 5905, recommending the use of transport-protocol
    ephemeral port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP well-known port
    is not required.
