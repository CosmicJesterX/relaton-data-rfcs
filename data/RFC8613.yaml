abstract:
- content: This document defines Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE), a method for application-layer protection of the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). OSCORE provides
    end-to-end protection between endpoints communicating using CoAP or CoAP-mappable
    HTTP. OSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks supporting a range
    of proxy operations, including translation between different transport protocols.
    Although an optional functionality of CoAP, OSCORE alters CoAP options processing
    and IANA registration. Therefore, this document updates RFC 7252.
