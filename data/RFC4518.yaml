abstract:
- content: The previous Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) technical specifications
    did not precisely define how character string matching is to be performed.  This
    led to a number of usability and interoperability problems.  This document defines
    string preparation algorithms for character-based matching rules defined for use
    in LDAP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
