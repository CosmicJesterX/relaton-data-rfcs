abstract:
  content: This document provides a general mechanism to use the header extension
    feature of RTP (the Real-Time Transport Protocol).  It provides the option to
    use a small number of small extensions in each RTP packet, where the universe
    of possible extensions is large and registration is de-centralized.  The actual
    extensions in use in a session are signaled in the setup information for that
    session. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
