abstract:
  content: In the original Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME document (RFC 2634),
    a structure for cryptographically linking the certificate to be used in validation
    with the signature was introduced; this structure was hardwired to use SHA-1.  This
    document allows for the structure to have algorithm agility and defines a new
    attribute for this purpose. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
