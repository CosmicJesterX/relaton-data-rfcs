abstract:
  content: This document specifies the requirements and uses cases for some optional
    administrative operations for use with the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) version
    1.0 and version 1.1.  Some of these administrative operations operate on the IPP
    Job and Printer objects.  The remaining operations operate on a new Device object
    that more closely models a single output device.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
