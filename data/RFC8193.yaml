abstract:
- content: This Information Model applies to the Measurement Agent within an LMAP
    framework.  As such, it outlines the information that is configured or preconfigured
    on the Measurement Agent or exists in communications with a Controller or Collector
    within an LMAP framework.  The purpose of such an Information Model is to provide
    a protocol- and device-independent view of the Measurement Agent that can be implemented
    via one or more Control and Report Protocols.
