abstract:
  content: The PIM Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) Vector TLV defined in RFC 5496 can
    be included in a PIM Join Attribute such that the RPF neighbor is selected based
    on the unicast reachability of the RPF Vector instead of the source or Rendezvous
    Point associated with the multicast tree. This document defines a new RPF Vector
    Attribute type such that an explicit RPF neighbor list can be encoded in the PIM
    Join Attribute, thus bypassing the unicast route lookup.
