abstract:
  content: Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent using
    spoofed addresses -- "spoofed" in this case means that the address is used without
    the permission of the domain owner.  This document describes a family of tests
    by which SMTP servers can determine whether an e-mail address in a received message
    was used with the permission of the owner of the domain contained in that e-mail
    address.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
