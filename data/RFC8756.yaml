abstract:
- content: This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management over CMS
    (CMC) protocol for managing X.509 public key certificates in applications that
    use the Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite published by the United
    States Government. The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and
    operation of all components of US National Security Systems that manage X.509
    public key certificates over CMS. It is also appropriate for all other US Government
    systems that process high-value information. The profile is made publicly available
    here for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.
