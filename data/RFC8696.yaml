abstract:
  content: The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious challenge
    for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed today.  The Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport and key agreement algorithms that
    could be broken by the invention of such a quantum computer.  By storing communications
    that are protected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them in the future
    when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available.  Once quantum-secure key
    management algorithms are available, the CMS will be extended to support the new
    algorithms if the existing syntax does not accommodate them.  This document describes
    a mechanism to protect today's communication from the future invention of a large-scale
    quantum computer by mixing the output of key transport and key agreement algorithms
    with a pre-shared key.
