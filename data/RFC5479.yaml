abstract:
- content: This document describes requirements for a protocol to negotiate a security
    context for SIP-signaled Secure RTP (SRTP) media.  In addition to the natural
    security requirements, this negotiation protocol must interoperate well with SIP
    in certain ways.  A number of proposals have been published and a summary of these
    proposals is in the appendix of this document.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
