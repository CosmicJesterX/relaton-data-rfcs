abstract:
- content: The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC Series.  This
    document applies specifically to the archivist role of the RFC Editor.  It provides
    guidance on when and how to preserve RFCs and describes the tools required to
    view or re-create RFCs as necessary.  This document also highlights gaps in the
    current process and suggests compromises to balance cost with best practice.
