abstract:
  content: This memo utilizes IP performance metrics that are applicable to both complete
    paths and sub-paths, and it defines relationships to compose a complete path metric
    from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy with regard to the actual metrics.  This
    is called "spatial composition" in RFC 2330.  The memo refers to the framework
    for metric composition, and provides background and motivation for combining metrics
    to derive others.  The descriptions of several composed metrics and statistics
    follow. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
