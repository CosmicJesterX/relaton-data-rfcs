abstract:
  content: This document describes features of an MPLS path monitoring system and
    related use cases.  Segment-based routing enables a scalable and simple method
    to monitor data-plane liveliness of the complete set of paths belonging to a single
    domain.  The MPLS monitoring system adds features to the traditional MPLS ping
    and Label Switched Path (LSP) trace, in a very complementary way.  MPLS topology
    awareness reduces management and control-plane involvement of Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) measurements while enabling new OAM features.
