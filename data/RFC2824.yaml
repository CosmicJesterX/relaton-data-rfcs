abstract:
  content: This document describes an architectural framework we call a processing
    language, as a simple and standardized way for implementing and deploying Internet
    telephony.  A large number of the services we wish to make possible for Internet
    telephony require fairly elaborate combinations of signalling operations, often
    in network devices, to complete.  It also outlines requirements for such a language.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
