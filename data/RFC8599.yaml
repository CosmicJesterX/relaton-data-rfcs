abstract:
  content: This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be used
    to wake a suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) with push
    notifications, and it also describes how the UA can send binding-refresh REGISTER
    requests and receive incoming SIP requests in an environment in which the UA may
    be suspended.  The document defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange PNS information
    between the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that push notifications
    be sent to the UA.  It also defines the parameters to trigger such push notification
    requests.  The document also defines new feature-capability indicators that can
    be used to indicate support of this mechanism.
