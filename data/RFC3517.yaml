abstract:
  content: This document presents a conservative loss recovery algorithm for TCP that
    is based on the use of the selective acknowledgment (SACK) TCP option.  The algorithm
    presented in this document conforms to the spirit of the current congestion control
    specification (RFC 2581), but allows TCP senders to recover more effectively when
    multiple segments are lost from a single flight of data. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
