abstract:
- content: Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are typically
    performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a Routing Information
    Base (RIB).  Protocols and configurations push data into the RIB, and the RIB
    manager installs state into the hardware for packet forwarding.  This document
    specifies an information model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data
    model.  The IETF's I2RS WG used this document to design the I2RS RIB data model.  This
    document is being published to record the higher- level information model decisions
    for RIBs so that other developers of RIBs may benefit from the design concepts.
