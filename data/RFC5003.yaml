abstract:
  content: The signaling protocols used to establish point-to-point pseudowires include
    type-length-value (TLV) fields that identify pseudowire endpoints called attachment
    individual identifiers (AIIs).  This document defines AII structures in the form
    of new AII TLV fields that support AII aggregation for improved scalability and
    Virtual Private Network (VPN) auto-discovery.  It is envisioned that this would
    be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where pseudowires
    are established between selected local and remote provider edge (PE) nodes based
    on customer need. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
