abstract:
  content: The Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group of the Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined a number of certificate management protocols.  These
    protocols are primarily focused on X.509v3 public-key certificates.  However,
    it is sometimes desirable to manage certificates in alternative formats as well.  This
    document specifies how such certificates may be requested using the Certificate
    Request Message Format (CRMF) syntax that is used by several different protocols.  It
    also explains how alternative certificate formats may be incorporated into such
    popular protocols as PKIX Certificate Management Protocol (PKIX-CMP) and Certificate
    Management Messages over CMS (CMC).  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
