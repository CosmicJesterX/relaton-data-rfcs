abstract:
  content: This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a security-aware
    validating resolver configured to use a forwarding resolver to send a single query,
    requesting a complete validation path along with the regular query answer.  The
    reduction in queries potentially lowers the latency and reduces the need to send
    multiple queries at once.  This extension mandates the use of source-IP- verified
    transport such as TCP or UDP with EDNS-COOKIE, so it cannot be abused in amplification
    attacks.
