abstract:
  content: The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active Measurement
    Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanisms require that both the client and server endpoints
    possess a shared secret.  This document describes the use of keys derived from
    an IKEv2 security association (SA) as the shared key in OWAMP or TWAMP.  If the
    shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, OWAMP or TWAMP can support certificate-based
    key exchange; this would allow for more operational flexibility and efficiency.  The
    key derivation presented in this document can also facilitate automatic key management.
