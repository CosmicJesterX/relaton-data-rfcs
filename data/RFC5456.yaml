abstract:
- content: This document describes IAX, the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol, an application-layer
    control and media protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating multimedia
    sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IAX was developed by the open source
    community for the Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is targeted primarily
    at Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used with streaming
    video or any other type of multimedia. IAX is an "all in one" protocol for handling
    multimedia in IP networks. It combines both control and media services in the
    same protocol. In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static port
    greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating
    the need for other protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall
    management. IAX employs a compact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and
    is well suited for Internet telephony service. In addition, its open nature permits
    new payload type additions needed to support additional services. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
