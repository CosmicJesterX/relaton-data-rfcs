abstract:
  content: This document describes a framework for traceability in the Interface to
    the Routing System (I2RS) and the information model for that framework.  It specifies
    the motivation, requirements, and use cases, and defines an information model
    for recording interactions between elements implementing the I2RS protocol.  This
    framework provides a consistent tracing interface for components implementing
    the I2RS architecture to record what was done, by which component, and when.  It
    aims to improve the management of I2RS implementations, and can be used for troubleshooting,
    auditing, forensics, and accounting purposes.
