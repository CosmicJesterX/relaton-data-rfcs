abstract:
  content: This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol
    for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization of the classical
    link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN.  The
    key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are
    selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This
    technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical
    flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives
    the first copy of the message.  In OLSR, link state information is generated only
    by nodes elected as MPRs.  Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing
    the number of control messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization,
    an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors.  Hence,
    as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information
    is distributed in the network.  This information is then used for route calculation.  OLSR
    provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is particularly
    suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this
    context.
