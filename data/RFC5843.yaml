abstract:
- content: The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm
    Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by Instance Digests in HTTP.  Instance
    Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or hash, of an entire
    representation of the current state of a resource.  This document adds new values
    to the registry and updates previous values.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
