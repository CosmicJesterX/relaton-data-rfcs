abstract:
  content: This document is one of a set of documents that together describe all aspects
    of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an application-level protocol
    that can be used for distributed printing on the Internet.  There are multiple
    parts to IPP, but the primary architectural components are the Model, the Protocol,
    and an interface to Directory Services.  This document provides a statement of
    the requirements for notifications as an optional part of an IPP Service.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
