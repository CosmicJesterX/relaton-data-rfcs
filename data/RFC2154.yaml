abstract:
  content: This memo describes the extensions to OSPF required to add digital signature
    authentication to Link State data, and to provide a certification mechanism for
    router data.  Added LSA processing and key management is detailed.  A method for
    migration from, or co-existence with, standard OSPF V2 is described.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
