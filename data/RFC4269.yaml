abstract:
- content: This document describes the SEED encryption algorithm, which has been adopted
    by most of the security systems in the Republic of Korea. Included are a description
    of the encryption and the key scheduling algorithm (Section 2), the S-boxes (Appendix
    A), and a set of test vectors (Appendix B). This document obsoletes RFC 4009.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.
