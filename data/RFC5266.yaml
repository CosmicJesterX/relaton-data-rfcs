abstract:
- content: Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when they roam
    and connect to the services offered in the enterprise.  Secure connectivity is
    required when the user connects to the enterprise from an untrusted network.  Mobility
    is beneficial when the user moves, either inside or outside the enterprise network,
    and acquires a new IP address.  This document describes a solution using Mobile
    IPv4 (MIPv4) and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure connectivity
    and mobility.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for
    the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
