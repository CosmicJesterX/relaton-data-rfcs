abstract:
  content: The Domain Name System's wire protocol includes a number of fixed fields
    whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not allow requestors to
    advertise their capabilities to responders. This document describes backward-compatible
    mechanisms for allowing the protocol to grow. This document updates the Extension
    Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) specification (and obsoletes RFC 2671) based on feedback
    from deployment experience in several implementations. It also obsoletes RFC 2673
    ("Binary Labels in the Domain Name System") and adds considerations on the use
    of extended labels in the DNS.
