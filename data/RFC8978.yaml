abstract:
  content: In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6 prefixes
    becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling of that condition
    (such as when a Customer Edge router crashes and reboots without knowledge of
    the previously employed prefixes), hosts on the local network may continue using
    stale prefixes for an unacceptably long time (on the order of several days), thus
    resulting in connectivity problems.  This document describes this issue and discusses
    operational workarounds that may help to improve network robustness.  Additionally,
    it highlights areas where further work may be needed.
