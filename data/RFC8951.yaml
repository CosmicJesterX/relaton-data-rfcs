abstract:
  content: 'This document updates RFC 7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport to resolve
    some errata that were reported and that have proven to cause interoperability
    issues when RFC 7030 was extended. This document deprecates the specification
    of "Content-Transfer-Encoding" headers for Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
    endpoints. This document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that were present.'
