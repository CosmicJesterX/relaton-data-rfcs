abstract:
  content: This memo defines InMon Corporation's sFlow system.  sFlow is a technology
    for monitoring traffic in data networks containing switches and routers.  In particular,
    it defines the sampling mechanisms implemented in an sFlow Agent for monitoring
    traffic, the sFlow MIB for controlling the sFlow Agent, and the format of sample
    data used by the sFlow Agent when forwarding data to a central data collector.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
