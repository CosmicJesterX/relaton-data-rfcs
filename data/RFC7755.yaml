abstract:
  content: This document describes the use of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm
    (SIIT) in an IPv6 Internet Data Center (IDC). In this deployment model, traffic
    from legacy IPv4-only clients on the Internet is translated to IPv6 upon reaching
    the IDC operator's network infrastructure. From that point on, it may be treated
    the same as traffic from native IPv6 end users. The IPv6 endpoints may be numbered
    using arbitrary (non-IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses. This facilitates a single-stack
    IPv6-only network infrastructure, as well as efficient utilization of public IPv4
    addresses. The primary audience is IDC operators who are deploying IPv6, running
    out of available IPv4 addresses, and/or feeling that dual stack causes undesirable
    operational complexity.
