abstract:
  content: 'This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding of collaboration
    on standards development between the Telecommunication Standardization Sector
    of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) of the Internet Society (ISOC). It is an update of and obsoletes
    RFC 3356. The updates reflect changes in the IETF and ITU-T since RFC 3356 was
    written. The bulk of this document is common text with ITU-T A Series Supplement
    3 (07/2012). Note: This was approved by TSAG on 4 July 2012 as Supplement 3 to
    the ITU-T A-Series of Recommendations. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.'
