abstract:
  content: This document specifies a few extensions to the messages defined in the
    Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF). They are helpful primarily in conversational
    multimedia scenarios where centralized multipoint functionalities are in use.
    However, some are also usable in smaller multicast environments and point-to-point
    calls. The extensions discussed are messages related to the ITU-T Rec. H.271 Video
    Back Channel, Full Intra Request, Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate, and
    Temporal-Spatial Trade-off. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
