abstract:
- content: When the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group was chartered, an object identifier
    arc was donated by RSA Data Security for use by that working group.  This document
    describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated arc, transfers
    control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any
    future assignments within that arc.
