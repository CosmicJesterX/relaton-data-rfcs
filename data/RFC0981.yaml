abstract:
  content: This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental, multiple
    routing algorithms that compute quasi-optimum routes for stations sharing a packet-radio
    broadcast channel.  The primary route (a minimum-distance path), and additional
    paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate routes should the primary
    route fail, are computed.  This prototype is presented as an example of a class
    of routing algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider
    application in the Internet community.  Discussions and suggestions for improvements
    are welcomed.
