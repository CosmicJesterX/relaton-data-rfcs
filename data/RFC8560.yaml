abstract:
  content: 'This document specifies mechanisms for backward compatibility of Ethernet
    VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridge Ethernet VPN (PBB-EVPN) solutions with
    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Provider Backbone Bridge VPLS (PBB-VPLS)
    solutions.  It also provides mechanisms for the seamless integration of these
    two technologies in the same MPLS/IP network on a per-VPN-instance basis.  Implementation
    of this document enables service providers to introduce EVPN/PBB-EVPN Provider
    Edges (PEs) in their brownfield deployments of VPLS/PBB-VPLS networks.  This document
    specifies the control-plane and forwarding behavior needed for the auto-discovery
    of the following: 1) a VPN instance, 2) multicast and unicast operation, and 3)
    a Media Access Control (MAC) mobility operation.  This enables seamless integration
    between EVPN and VPLS PEs as well as between PBB-VPLS and PBB-EVPN PEs.'
