abstract:
  content: The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of encapsulating
    network-layer protocol information over point-to-point links. PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a family of Network Control
    Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.
    The IPv6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP), which is an NCP for a PPP link, allows for
    the negotiation of desirable parameters for an IPv6 interface over PPP. This document
    defines the IPv6 datagram compression option that can be negotiated by a node
    on the link through the IPV6CP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
