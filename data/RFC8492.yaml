abstract:
  content: This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) protocol to support certificateless, secure authentication using only a
    simple, low-entropy password.  The exchange is called "TLS-PWD".  The ciphersuites
    are all based on an authentication and key exchange protocol, named "dragonfly",
    that is resistant to offline dictionary attacks.
