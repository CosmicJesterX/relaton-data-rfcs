abstract:
  content: The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is nearing
    exhaustion of its current 8-bit Attribute Type space.  In addition, experience
    shows a growing need for complex grouping, along with attributes that can carry
    more than 253 octets of data.  This document defines changes to RADIUS that address
    all of the above problems.
