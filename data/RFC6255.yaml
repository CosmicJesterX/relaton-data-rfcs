abstract:
- content: The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Research Group research group has defined
    many protocols such as the Bundle Protocol and Licklider Transmission Protocol.  The
    specifications of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For
    the purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc registries.  As the
    specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the
    group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.  This
    document describes the actions executed by IANA.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
