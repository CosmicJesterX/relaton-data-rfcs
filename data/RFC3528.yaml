abstract:
  content: This document describes the Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol (mSLP).  mSLP
    enhances the Service Location Protocol (SLP) with a scope-based fully-meshed peering
    Directory Agent (DA) architecture.  Peer DAs exchange new service registrations
    in shared scopes via anti- entropy and direct forwarding.  mSLP improves the reliability
    and consistency of SLP DA services, and simplifies Service Agent (SA) registrations
    in systems with multiple DAs.  mSLP is backward compatible with SLPv2 and can
    be deployed incrementally.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.
