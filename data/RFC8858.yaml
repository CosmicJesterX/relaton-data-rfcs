abstract:
  content: This document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level
    attribute, 'rtcp-mux-only', that can be used by an endpoint to indicate exclusive
    support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing.  The document also
    updates RFC 5761 by clarifying that an offerer can use a mechanism to indicate
    that it is not able to send and receive RTCP on separate ports.
