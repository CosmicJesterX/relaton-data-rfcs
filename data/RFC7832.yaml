abstract:
  content: Federated identity is typically associated with web-based services at present,
    but there is growing interest in its application in non-web-based contexts.  The
    goal of this memo is to document a selection of the wide variety of these contexts
    whose user experience could be improved through the use of technologies based
    on the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) architecture
    and specifications.
