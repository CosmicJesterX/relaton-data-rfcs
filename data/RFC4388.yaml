abstract:
  content: A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4) server is the
    authoritative source of IP addresses that it has provided to DHCPv4 clients.  Other
    processes and devices that already make use of DHCPv4 may need to access this
    information.  The leasequery protocol provides these processes and devices a lightweight
    way to access IP address information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
