abstract:
- content: This document defines Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD),
    a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of negotiation aspects
    eliminated, thus providing benefits such as quick provisioning, as well as improved
    control and flexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring. This document
    updates RFC 5880.
