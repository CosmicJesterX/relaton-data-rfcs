abstract:
  content: Segment Routing (SR) allows a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within
    IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological subpaths called "segments".
    These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).
    This document describes the OSPFv3 extensions required for Segment Routing with
    the MPLS data plane.
