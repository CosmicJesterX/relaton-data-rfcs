abstract:
  content: The base IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    has a TRILL campus-wide MTU feature, specified in RFCs 6325 and 7177, that assures
    that link-state changes can be successfully flooded throughout the campus while
    being able to take advantage of a campus-wide capability to support jumbo packets.  This
    document specifies recommended updates to that MTU feature to take advantage,
    for appropriate link-local packets, of link-local MTUs that exceed the TRILL campus
    MTU.  In addition, it specifies an efficient algorithm for local MTU testing.  This
    document updates RFCs 6325, 7177, and 7780.
