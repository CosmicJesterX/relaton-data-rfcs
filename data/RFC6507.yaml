abstract:
- content: Many signature schemes currently in use rely on certificates for authentication
    of identity.  In Identity-based cryptography, this adds unnecessary overhead and
    administration.  The Elliptic Curve-based Certificateless Signatures for Identity-based
    Encryption (ECCSI) signature scheme described in this document is certificateless.  This
    scheme has the additional advantages of low bandwidth and low computational requirements.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
