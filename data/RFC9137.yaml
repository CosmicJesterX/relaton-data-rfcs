abstract:
  content: The IETF ordinarily holds three in-person meetings per year to discuss
    issues and advance the Internet.  However, various events can make a planned in-person
    meeting infeasible.  This document provides criteria to aid the IETF Administration
    LLC (IETF LLC), the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), and the Chair
    of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) in deciding to relocate, virtualize,
    postpone, or cancel an in-person IETF meeting.
