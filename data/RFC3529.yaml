abstract:
  content: Markup Language-Remote Procedure Calling protocol that works over the Internet.  It
    defines an XML format for messages that are transfered between clients and servers
    using HTTP.  An XML-RPC message encodes either a procedure to be invoked by the
    server, along with the parameters to use in the invocation, or the result of an
    invocation.  Procedure parameters and results can be scalars, numbers, strings,
    dates, etc.; they can also be complex record and list structures.  This document
    specifies a how to use the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) to transfer
    messages encoded in the XML-RPC format between clients and servers.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
