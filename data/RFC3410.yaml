abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third version
    of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP version 3 Framework
    (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard
    Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework
    (SNMPv2).  The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of
    the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1
    or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157,
    1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 2570.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
