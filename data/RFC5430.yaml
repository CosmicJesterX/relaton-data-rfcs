abstract:
  content: The United States government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite B
    Cryptography", which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security
    applications.  This document defines a profile of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    version 1.2 that is fully conformant with Suite B.  This document also defines
    a transitional profile for use with TLS version 1.0 and TLS version 1.1 which
    employs Suite B algorithms to the greatest extent possible.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
