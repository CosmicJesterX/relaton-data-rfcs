abstract:
  content: Although the use of the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Reason header
    field in responses is considered in general in RFC 3326, its use is not specified
    for any particular response code.  Nonetheless, existing deployments have been
    using Reason header fields to carry failure-related Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses
    to INVITE requests that have been gatewayed to Public Switched Telephone Network
    (PSTN) systems.  This document normatively describes the use of the Reason header
    field in carrying Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
