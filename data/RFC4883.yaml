abstract:
  content: The primary purpose of this document is to define terminology specific
    to the benchmarking of resource reservation signaling of Integrated Services (IntServ)
    IP routers.  These terms can be used in additional documents that define benchmarking
    methodologies for routers that support resource reservation or reporting formats
    for the benchmarking measurements.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
