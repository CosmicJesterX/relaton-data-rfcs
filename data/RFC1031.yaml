abstract:
- content: 'This RFC consolidates information necessary for the implementation of
    domain style names throughout the DDN/MILNET Internet community.  The introduction
    of domain style names will impact all hosts in the DDN/MILNET Internet.  This
    RFC is designed as an aid to implementors and administrators by providing: 1)
    an overview of the transition process from host tables to domains, 2) a timetable
    for the transition, and 3) references to documentation and software relating to
    the domain system.'
