abstract:
- content: It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access technologies
    to gain network connectivity.  Currently there are access-specific mechanisms
    for providing client information to the network for authentication and authorization
    purposes.  In addition to being limited to specific access media (e.g., 802.1X
    for IEEE 802 links), some of these protocols are limited to specific network topologies
    (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links).  The goal of this document is to identify
    the requirements for a link-layer agnostic protocol that allows a host and a network
    to authenticate each other for network access.  This protocol will run between
    a client's device and an agent in the network where the agent might be a client
    of the AAA infrastructure.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
