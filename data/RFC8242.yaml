abstract:
  content: '"An Architecture for the Interface to the Routing System" (RFC 7921) abstractly
    describes a number of requirements for ephemeral state (in terms of capabilities
    and behaviors) that any protocol suite attempting to meet the needs of the Interface
    to the Routing System (I2RS) protocol has to provide.  This document describes,
    in detail, requirements for ephemeral state for those implementing the I2RS protocol.'
