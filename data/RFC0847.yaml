- content: This is a summary of the surveys of Telnet, FTP and Mail (SMTP) servers
    conducted by David Smallberg in December 1982, January and February 1983 as reported
    in RFC 832-843, 845-846.  This memo extracts the number of hosts that accepted
    the connection to their server for each of Telnet, FTP, and SMTP, and compares
    it to the total host in the Internet (not counting TACs or ECHOS).
