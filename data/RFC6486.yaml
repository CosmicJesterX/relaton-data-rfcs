abstract:
- content: This document defines a "manifest" for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI).  A manifest is a signed object (file) that contains a listing of all the
    signed objects (files) in the repository publication point (directory) associated
    with an authority responsible for publishing in the repository.  For each certificate,
    Certificate Revocation List (CRL), or other type of signed objects issued by the
    authority that are published at this repository publication point, the manifest
    contains both the name of the file containing the object and a hash of the file
    content.  Manifests are intended to enable a relying party (RP) to detect certain
    forms of attacks against a repository.  Specifically, if an RP checks a manifest's
    contents against the signed objects retrieved from a repository publication point,
    then the RP can detect "stale" (valid) data and deletion of signed objects. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
