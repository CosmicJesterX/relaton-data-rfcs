abstract:
- content: This document describes the Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) Proxy
    ARP/ND function augmented by the capability of the ARP/ND Extended Community.  From
    that perspective, this document updates the EVPN specification to provide more
    comprehensive documentation of the operation of the Proxy ARP/ND function.  The
    EVPN Proxy ARP/ND function and the ARP/ND Extended Community help operators of
    Internet Exchange Points, Data Centers, and other networks deal with IPv4 and
    IPv6 address resolution issues associated with large Broadcast Domains by reducing
    and even suppressing the flooding produced by address resolution in the EVPN network.
