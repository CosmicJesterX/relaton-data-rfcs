abstract:
- content: Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) schemes are interactive protocols
    that allow the participants to authenticate each other and derive shared cryptographic
    keys using a (weaker) shared password.  This document reviews different types
    of PAKE schemes.  Furthermore, it presents requirements and gives recommendations
    to designers of new schemes.  It is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group
    (CFRG).
