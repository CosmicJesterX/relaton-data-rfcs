abstract:
  content: Modern forwarding devices attempt to minimize any control- and data-plane
    disruptions while performing planned software changes by implementing a technique
    commonly known as In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU).  This document specifies
    a set of common methodologies and procedures designed to characterize the overall
    behavior of a Device Under Test (DUT), subject to an ISSU event.
