abstract:
  content: This document proposes unified Layer 2 (L2) abstractions for Layer 3 (L3)-driven
    fast handovers.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol
    layer to know or utilize other layers' information, such as the form of L2 triggers.  However,
    each protocol layer is basically designed independently.  Since each protocol
    layer is also implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very
    hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.  This document defines
    nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of "primitives" to achieve fast handovers
    in the network layer as a means of solving the problem.  This mechanism is called
    "L3-driven fast handovers" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers
    by using the primitives.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations
    (MobOpts) Research Group.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.
