abstract:
  content: For the practical use of ISO 10646, a lot of external profiling such as
    restriction of characters, restriction of combination of characters and addition
    of language information is necessary.  This memo provides information on such
    profiling, along with charset names to each profiled instance.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet
    standard of any kind.
