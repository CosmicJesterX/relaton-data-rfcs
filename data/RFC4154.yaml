abstract:
- content: This document specifies the Voucher Trading System Application Programming
    Interface (VTS-API).  The VTS-API allows a wallet or other application to issue,
    transfer, and redeem vouchers in a uniform manner independent of the VTS implementation.  The
    VTS is a system for securely transferring vouchers; e.g., coupons, tickets, loyalty
    points, and gift certificates.  This process is often necessary in the course
    of payment and/or delivery transactions.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
