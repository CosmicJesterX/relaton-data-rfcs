abstract:
  content: This document describes a protocol for asking an IPv6 node to supply certain
    network information, such as its hostname or fully-qualified domain name.  IPv6
    implementation experience has shown that direct queries for a hostname are useful,
    and a direct query mechanism for other information has been found useful in serverless
    environments and for debugging.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for
    the Internet community.
