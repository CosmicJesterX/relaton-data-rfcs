abstract:
  content: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to provide
    a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the User Agent (UA) as an alerting
    signal (e.g., a ring tone or ringback tone) when the user is alerted. This is
    done using the Alert-Info header field. However, the reference (typically a URL)
    addresses only a specific network resource with specific rendering properties.
    There is currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the semantics
    of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without
    being tied to a particular rendering. To overcome these limitations and support
    new applications, a new family of URNs for use in Alert-Info header fields (and
    situations with similar requirements) is defined in this specification. This document
    normatively updates RFC 3261, which defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
    It changes the usage of the Alert-Info header field defined in RFC 3261 by additionally
    allowing its use in any non-100 provisional response to INVITE. This document
    also permits proxies to add or remove an Alert-Info header field and to add or
    remove Alert-Info header field values.
