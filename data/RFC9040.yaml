abstract:
- content: This memo provides guidance to TCP implementers that is intended to help
    improve connection convergence to steady-state operation without affecting interoperability.  It
    updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of sharing TCP state, as typically
    represented in TCP Control Blocks, among similar concurrent or consecutive connections.
