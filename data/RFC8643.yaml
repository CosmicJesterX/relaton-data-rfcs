abstract:
  content: Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) is an implementation
    of the Opportunistic Security mechanism, as defined in RFC 7435, applied to the
    Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  OSRTP allows encrypted media to be used in
    environments where support for encryption is not known in advance and is not required.  OSRTP
    does not require Session Description Protocol (SDP) extensions or features and
    is fully backwards compatible with existing implementations using encrypted and
    authenticated media and implementations that do not encrypt or authenticate media
    packets.  OSRTP is not specific to any key management technique for Secure RTP
    (SRTP).  OSRTP is a transitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments
    of real-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated state.
