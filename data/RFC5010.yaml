abstract:
  content: This memo defines a new suboption of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) relay agent information option that allows the DHCP relay to specify flags
    for the forwarded packet.  One flag is defined to indicate whether the DHCP relay
    received the packet via a unicast or broadcast packet.  This information may be
    used by the DHCP server to better serve clients based on whether their request
    was originally broadcast or unicast. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
