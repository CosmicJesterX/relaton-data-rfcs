abstract:
- content: A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment
    of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer
    protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The
    control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with
    the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and
    IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A
    tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This
    document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
