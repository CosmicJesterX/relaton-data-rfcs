abstract:
  content: When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6
    path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences
    significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable
    because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This
    document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay
    and provides an algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
