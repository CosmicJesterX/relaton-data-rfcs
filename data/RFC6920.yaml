abstract:
  content: This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object
    in this case) using the output from a hash function.  It specifies a new URI scheme
    for this purpose, a way to map these to HTTP URLs, and binary and human-speakable
    formats for these names.  The various formats are designed to support, but not
    require, a strong link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object
    may be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it.  The reason for
    this work is to standardise current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support
    new information-centric applications and other uses of hash outputs in protocols.
