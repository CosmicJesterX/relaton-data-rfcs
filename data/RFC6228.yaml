abstract:
  content: This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response
    code, 199 Early Dialog Terminated, that a SIP forking proxy and a User Agent Server
    (UAS) can use to indicate to upstream SIP entities (including the User Agent Client
    (UAC)) that an early dialog has been terminated, before a final response is sent
    towards the SIP entities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
