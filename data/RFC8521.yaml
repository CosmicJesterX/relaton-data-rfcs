abstract:
  content: The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) includes a method that can
    be used to identify the authoritative server for processing domain name, IP address,
    and autonomous system number queries.  The method does not describe how to identify
    the authoritative server for processing other RDAP query types, such as entity
    queries.  This limitation exists because the identifiers associated with these
    query types are typically unstructured.  This document updates RFC 7484 by describing
    an operational practice that can be used to add structure to RDAP identifiers
    and that makes it possible to identify the authoritative server for additional
    RDAP queries.
