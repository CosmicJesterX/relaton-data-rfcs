abstract:
  content: There are ongoing activities in the networking community to develop solutions
    that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless access
    systems including, but not limited to, IEEE 802.21.  Intelligent access selection,
    taking into account link-layer attributes, requires the delivery of a variety
    of different information types to the terminal from different sources within the
    network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this signalling have both
    transport and security issues that must be considered.  The signalling must not
    be constrained to specific link types, so there is at least a common component
    to the signalling problem, which is within the scope of the IETF.  This document
    presents a problem statement for this core problem.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
