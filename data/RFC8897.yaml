abstract:
  content: This document provides a single reference point for requirements for Relying
    Party (RP) software for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  It
    cites requirements that appear in several RPKI RFCs, making it easier for implementers
    to become aware of these requirements.  Over time, this RFC will be updated to
    reflect changes to the requirements and guidance specified in the RFCs discussed
    herein.
