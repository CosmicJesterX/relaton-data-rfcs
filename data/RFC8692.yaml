abstract:
  content: Digital signatures are used to sign messages, X.509 certificates, and Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRLs).  This document updates the "Algorithms and Identifiers
    for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation
    List (CRL) Profile" (RFC 3279) and describes the conventions for using the SHAKE
    function family in Internet X.509 certificates and revocation lists as one-way
    hash functions with the RSA Probabilistic signature and Elliptic Curve Digital
    Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature algorithms.  The conventions for the associated
    subject public keys are also described.
