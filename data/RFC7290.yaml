abstract:
  content: This memo provides the supporting test plan and results to advance RFC
    2680, a performance metric RFC defining one-way packet loss metrics, along the
    Standards Track.  Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the
    primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo describes
    the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement clauses to determine
    if the requirement has been interpreted and implemented as intended.  Two completely
    independent implementations have been tested against the key specifications of
    RFC 2680.
