abstract:
- content: Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    directory, whose values may be transferred in the LDAP protocol, has a defined
    syntax that constrains the structure and format of its values.  The comparison
    semantics for values of a syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are
    instead provided through separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify
    an argument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This document
    defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in defining attributes
    for LDAP directories. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
