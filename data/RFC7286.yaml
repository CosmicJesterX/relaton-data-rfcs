abstract:
  content: The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of
    candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server
    protocol. Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance, it needs to discover one
    or more ALTO servers. This document specifies a procedure for resource-consumer-initiated
    ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is embedded in the
    resource consumer.
