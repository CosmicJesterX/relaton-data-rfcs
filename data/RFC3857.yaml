abstract:
- content: This document defines the watcher information template-package for the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework.  Watcher information refers
    to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event
    package.  Watcher information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe,
    are approved, or are rejected.  A user can subscribe to this information, and
    therefore learn about changes to it.  This event package is a template-package
    because it can be applied to any event package, including itself. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
