abstract:
- content: This document defines a protocol for publishing Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) objects.  Even though the RPKI will have many participants issuing certificates
    and creating other objects, it is operationally useful to consolidate the publication
    of those objects.  Even in cases where a certificate issuer runs its own publication
    repository, it can be useful to run the certificate engine itself on a different
    machine from the publication repository.  This document defines a protocol which
    addresses these needs.
