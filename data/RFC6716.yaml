abstract:
  content: This document defines the Opus interactive speech and audio codec.  Opus
    is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including
    Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even live, distributed music
    performances.  It scales from low bitrate narrowband speech at 6 kbit/s to very
    high quality stereo music at 510 kbit/s.  Opus uses both Linear Prediction (LP)
    and the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) to achieve good compression
    of both speech and music. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
