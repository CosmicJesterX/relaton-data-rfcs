abstract:
  content: This memo updates RFC 4733 to add event codes for telephony signals used
    for channel-associated signalling when carried in the telephony event RTP payload.  It
    supersedes and adds to the original assignment of event codes for this purpose
    in Section 3.14 of RFC 2833.  As documented in Appendix A of RFC 4733, some of
    the RFC 2833 events have been deprecated because their specification was ambiguous,
    erroneous, or redundant.  In fact, the degree of change from Section 3.14 of RFC
    2833 is such that implementations of the present document will be fully backward
    compatible with RFC 2833 implementations only in the case of full ABCD-bit signalling.  This
    document expands and improves the coverage of signalling systems compared to RFC
    2833. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
