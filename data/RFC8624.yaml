abstract:
- content: The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order
    to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of nonexistence.  To ensure interoperability
    between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to specify
    a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure
    that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.  This document
    defines the current algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance for
    DNSSEC.  This document obsoletes RFC 6944.
