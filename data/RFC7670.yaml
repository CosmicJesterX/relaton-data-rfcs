abstract:
  content: The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol did have support for
    raw public keys, but it only supported RSA raw public keys.  In constrained environments,
    it is useful to make use of other types of public keys, such as those based on
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  This document updates RFC 7296, adding support for
    other types of raw public keys to IKEv2.
