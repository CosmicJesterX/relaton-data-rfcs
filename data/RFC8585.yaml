abstract:
  content: This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity requirements for IPv6
    Customer Edge (CE) routers that are provided either by the service provider or
    by vendors who sell through the retail market. Specifically, this document extends
    the basic requirements for IPv6 CE routers as described in RFC 7084 to allow the
    provisioning of IPv6 transition services for the support of IPv4-as-a-Service
    (IPv4aaS) by means of new transition mechanisms. The document only covers IPv4aaS,
    i.e., transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in IPv6-only access networks.
    IPv4aaS is necessary because there aren't sufficient IPv4 addresses available
    for every possible customer/ device. However, devices or applications in the customer
    Local Area Networks (LANs) may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only and still need to communicate
    with IPv4-only services on the Internet.
