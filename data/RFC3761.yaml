abstract:
  content: This document discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for storage
    of E.164 numbers.  More specifically, how DNS can be used for identifying available
    services connected to one E.164 number.  It specifically obsoletes RFC 2916 to
    bring it in line with the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application
    specification found in the document series specified in RFC 3401.  It is very
    important to note that it is impossible to read and understand this document without
    reading the documents discussed in RFC 3401. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
