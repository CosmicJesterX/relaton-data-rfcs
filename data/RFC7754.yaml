abstract:
- content: The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness
    is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow
    communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as
    the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive
    or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis
    on "blocking" and "filtering", the active prevention of such communications.  This
    document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering
    in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is
    possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent
    with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable
    services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable
    communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can
    cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy
    of various approaches.
