abstract:
  content: This document specifies a speech codec suitable for robust voice communication
    over IP.  The codec is developed by Global IP Sound (GIPS).  It is designed for
    narrow band speech and results in a payload bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s for 30 ms
    frames and 15.20 kbit/s for 20 ms frames.  The codec enables graceful speech quality
    degradation in the case of lost frames, which occurs in connection with lost or
    delayed IP packets.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.
