abstract:
- content: Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to a
    regular TCP session.  Even though it is designed to be totally backward compatible
    to applications, the data transport differs compared to regular TCP, and there
    are several additional degrees of freedom that applications may wish to exploit.  This
    document summarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such as changes
    in performance.  Furthermore, it discusses compatibility issues of MPTCP in combination
    with non-MPTCP-aware applications.  Finally, the document describes a basic application
    interface that is a simple extension of TCP's interface for MPTCP-aware applications.
