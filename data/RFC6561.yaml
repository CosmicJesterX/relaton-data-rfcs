abstract:
  content: This document contains recommendations on how Internet Service Providers
    can use various remediation techniques to manage the effects of malicious bot
    infestations on computers used by their subscribers.  Internet users with infected
    computers are exposed to risks such as loss of personal data and increased susceptibility
    to online fraud.  Such computers can also become inadvertent participants in or
    components of an online crime network, spam network, and/or phishing network as
    well as be used as a part of a distributed denial-of-service attack.  Mitigating
    the effects of and remediating the installations of malicious bots will make it
    more difficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online crime
    on the Internet in general and/or on a particular Internet Service Provider's
    network.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
