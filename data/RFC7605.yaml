abstract:
  content: This document provides recommendations to designers of application and
    service protocols on how to use the transport protocol port number space and when
    to request a port assignment from IANA.  It provides designer guidance to requesters
    or users of port numbers on how to interact with IANA using the processes defined
    in RFC 6335; thus, this document complements (but does not update) that document.
