abstract:
  content: This memo specifies semantics for a Middlebox Communication (MIDCOM) protocol
    to be used by MIDCOM agents for interacting with middleboxes such as firewalls
    and Network Address Translators (NATs).  The semantics discussion does not include
    any specification of a concrete syntax or a transport protocol.  However, a concrete
    protocol is expected to implement the specified semantics or, more likely, a superset
    of it.  The MIDCOM protocol semantics is derived from the MIDCOM requirements,
    from the MIDCOM framework, and from working group decisions.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
