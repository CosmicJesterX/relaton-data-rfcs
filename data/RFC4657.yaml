abstract:
- content: The PCE model is described in the "PCE Architecture" document and facilitates
    path computation requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs).  This document specifies generic requirements for a communication
    protocol between PCCs and PCEs, and also between PCEs where cooperation between
    PCEs is desirable.  Subsequent documents will specify application-specific requirements
    for the PCE communication protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
