abstract:
- content: This document describes how the S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
    Extensions) protocol can be processed and generated by a number of components
    of a communication system, such as message transfer agents, guards and gateways
    to deliver security services.  These services are collectively referred to as
    'Domain Security Services'.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.
