abstract:
- content: Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass point-to-multipoint
    (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with point-to-point MPLS LSPs, the requirement
    to detect, handle, and diagnose control and data plane defects is critical. For
    operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs, the detection and specification
    of how to handle those defects are important because such defects not only may
    affect the fundamentals of an MPLS network, but also may impact service level
    specification commitments for customers of their network. This document describes
    requirements for data plane operations and management for P2MP MPLS LSPs. These
    requirements apply to all forms of P2MP MPLS LSPs, and include P2MP Traffic Engineered
    (TE) LSPs and multicast LSPs. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
