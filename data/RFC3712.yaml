abstract:
  content: This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for printers
    and printer services, for use with directories that support Lightweight Directory
    Access Protocol v3 (LDAP-TS).  This document is based on the printer attributes
    listed in Appendix E of Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  A few
    additional printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB (RFC
    1759).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
