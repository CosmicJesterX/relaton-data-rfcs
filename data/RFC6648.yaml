abstract:
  content: Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols have
    often distinguished between standardized and unstandardized parameters by prefixing
    the names of unstandardized parameters with the string "X-" or similar constructs.  In
    practice, that convention causes more problems than it solves.  Therefore, this
    document deprecates the convention for newly defined parameters with textual (as
    opposed to numerical) names in application protocols.  This memo documents an
    Internet Best Current Practice.
