abstract:
  content: 'The Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks Working Group has
    been chartered to work on routing solutions for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs)
    in various markets: industrial, commercial (building), home, and urban networks.  Pursuant
    to this effort, this document defines the IPv6 routing requirements for building
    automation.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.'
