abstract:
  content: The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) includes the
    ability to assign metrics to links and to use those metrics to allow routing by
    other than minimum hop count routes.  This document provides a historic record
    of the rationale for, and design considerations behind, how link metrics were
    included in OLSRv2.
