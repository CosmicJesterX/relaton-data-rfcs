abstract:
  content: This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that measure the quality
    for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.  Voice call quality information
    derived from RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP-XR) and call information
    from SIP is conveyed from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter,
    to a third party, known as a collector.  A registration for the application/ vq-rtcpxr
    media type is also included. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
