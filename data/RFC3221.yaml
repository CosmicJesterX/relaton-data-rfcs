abstract:
  content: This document examines the various longer term trends visible within the
    characteristics of the Internet's BGP table and identifies a number of operational
    practices and protocol factors that contribute to these trends.  The potential
    impacts of these practices and protocol properties on the scaling properties of
    the inter-domain routing space are examined.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.
