abstract:
  content: This document describes an optional extension to Router Advertisement messages
    for communicating default router preferences and more-specific routes from routers
    to hosts.  This improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate router, especially
    when the host is multi-homed and the routers are on different links.  The preference
    values and specific routes advertised to hosts require administrative configuration;
    they are not automatically derived from routing tables. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
