abstract:
  content: This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved parity
    codes from source media encapsulated in RTP.  These parity codes are systematic
    codes (Flexible FEC, or "FLEX FEC"), where a number of FEC repair packets are
    generated from a set of source packets from one or more source RTP streams.  These
    FEC repair packets are sent in a redundancy RTP stream separate from the source
    RTP stream(s) that carries the source packets.  RTP source packets that were lost
    in transmission can be reconstructed using the source and repair packets that
    were received.  The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes that are defined
    in this specification offer a good protection against random and bursty packet
    losses, respectively, at a cost of complexity.  The RTP payload formats that are
    defined in this document address scalability issues experienced with the earlier
    specifications and offer several improvements.  Due to these changes, the new
    payload formats are not backward compatible with earlier specifications; however,
    endpoints that do not implement this specification can still work by simply ignoring
    the FEC repair packets.
