abstract:
- content: This document provides the functionalities and design considerations for
    a Name Resolution Service (NRS) in Information-Centric Networking (ICN).  The
    purpose of an NRS in ICN is to translate an object name into some other information
    such as a locator, another name, etc.  in order to forward the object request.  This
    document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).
