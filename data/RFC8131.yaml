abstract:
  content: In non-packet transport networks, there are requirements where the Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs to employ
    a restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for the working
    and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs. This
    document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation
    Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of a GMPLS end-to-end
    recovery scheme when using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down.
    In addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based setup and teardown
    of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures. No new signaling extensions are defined
    by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.
