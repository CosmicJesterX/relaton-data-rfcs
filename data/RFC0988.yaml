abstract:
- content: This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of
    the Internet Protocol (IP) to support internetwork multicasting.  This specification
    supersedes that given in RFC-966, and constitutes a proposed protocol standard
    for IP multicasting in the ARPA-Internet.  The reader is directed to RFC-966 for
    a discussion of the motivation and rationale behind the multicasting extension
    specified here.
