abstract:
- content: The Diameter protocol includes a capability for message redirection, controlled
    by an application-independent "redirect agent". In some circumstances, an operator
    may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual
    hosts. This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which a Diameter
    server or proxy (node) can perform such a redirection when the Straightforward-Naming
    Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) is not used for dynamic peer discovery. A node performing
    this new function is referred to as a "Realm-based Redirect Server". This memo
    updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC 6733 with respect to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage
    and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).
