abstract:
  content: This RFC is being distributed to members of the DARPA research community
    in order to solicit their reactions to the proposals contained in it.  While the
    issues discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems of the
    DARPA community, they may be interesting to a number of researchers and implementors.  This
    RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.
