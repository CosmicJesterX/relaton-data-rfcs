abstract:
  content: Mobile IPv6 enables a mobile node (MN) to maintain its connectivity to
    the Internet when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred
    to as handover. During handover, there is a period during which the mobile node
    is unable to send or receive packets because of link-switching delay and IP protocol
    operations. This "handover latency" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures
    (namely, movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding Update)
    is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Reducing
    the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive
    applications as well. This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency
    due to Mobile IPv6 procedures. This document does not address improving the link-switching
    latency. This document updates the packet formats for the Handover Initiate (HI)
    and Handover Acknowledge (HAck) messages to the Mobility Header Type. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
