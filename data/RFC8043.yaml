abstract:
  content: This document presents the source-address-dependent routing (SADR) problem
    space from the host's perspective. Both multihomed hosts and hosts with multiple
    interfaces are considered. Several network architectures are presented to illustrate
    why source address selection and next-hop resolution are needed in view of source-address-dependent
    routing. The document is scoped on identifying a set of scenarios for source-address-dependent
    routing from the host's perspective and analyzing a set of solutions to mitigate
    encountered issues. The document does not make any solution recommendations.
