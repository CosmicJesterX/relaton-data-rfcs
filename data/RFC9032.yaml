abstract:
  content: In the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE Std 802.15.4, opportunities
    for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels.  Routers in
    a TSCH network transmit Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to announce the presence of
    the network.  This document provides a mechanism by which additional information
    critical for new nodes (pledges) and long-sleeping nodes may be carried within
    the EB in order to conserve use of broadcast opportunities.
