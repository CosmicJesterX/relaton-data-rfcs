abstract:
  content: The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based management
    framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy.  These models point
    to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.  Policy
    rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level, possibly
    network-wide, policies to a network management function (within a controller,
    an orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function can then
    control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services.  This
    document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.
