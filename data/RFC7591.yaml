abstract:
  content: This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically registering OAuth
    2.0 clients with authorization servers.  Registration requests send a set of desired
    client metadata values to the authorization server.  The resulting registration
    responses return a client identifier to use at the authorization server and the
    client metadata values registered for the client.  The client can then use this
    registration information to communicate with the authorization server using the
    OAuth 2.0 protocol.  This specification also defines a set of common client metadata
    fields and values for clients to use during registration.
