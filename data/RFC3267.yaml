abstract:
  content: This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload format
    to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB)
    encoded speech signals.  The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate
    with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.  In addition,
    a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage
    mode applications such as email.  Two separate MIME type registrations are included,
    one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format
    and the storage format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
