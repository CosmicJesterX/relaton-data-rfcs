abstract:
- content: CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be transferred
    between two parties.  The claims in a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object
    Representation (CBOR), and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for
    added application-layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information
    asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of
    a claim name and a claim value.  CWT is derived from JSON Web Token (JWT) but
    uses CBOR rather than JSON.
