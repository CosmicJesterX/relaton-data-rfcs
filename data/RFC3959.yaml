abstract:
  content: This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the Content-Disposition
    header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The treatment of "early-session"
    bodies is similar to the treatment of "session" bodies.  That is, they follow
    the offer/answer model.  Their only difference is that session descriptions whose
    disposition type is "early-session" are used to establish early media sessions
    within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialogs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
