abstract:
  content: In the course of reviewing the MTU Discovery protocol for possible elevation
    to Draft Standard, a specific operational problem was uncovered.  The problem
    results from the optional suppression of ICMP messages implemented in some routers.  This
    memo outlines a modification to this practice to allow the correct functioning
    of MTU Discovery.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It
    does not specify an Internet standard.
