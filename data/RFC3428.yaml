abstract:
  content: Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages between users
    in near real-time.  These messages are usually, but not required to be, short.  IMs
    are often used in a conversational mode, that is, the transfer of messages back
    and forth is fast enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.  This
    document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) that allows the transfer of Instant Messages.  Since the MESSAGE request
    is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features
    of that protocol.  MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of MIME body
    parts.  MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal
    usage each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE requests
    may be sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
