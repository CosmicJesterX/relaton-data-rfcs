abstract:
- content: A Path Computation Element (PCE) can compute Traffic Engineering (TE) paths
    through a network; these paths are subject to various constraints.  Currently,
    TE paths are Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that are set up using the RSVP-TE signaling
    protocol.  However, other TE path setup methods are possible within the PCE architecture.  This
    document proposes an extension to the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to allow
    support for different path setup methods over a given PCEP session.
