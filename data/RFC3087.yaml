abstract:
- content: This memo describes a useful way to conceptualize the use of the standard
    SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Request-URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that
    the authors and many members of the SIP community think is suitable as a convention.  It
    does not define any new protocol with respect to RFC 2543.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
