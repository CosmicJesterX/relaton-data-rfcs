abstract:
  content: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication
    describes a mechanism with which a presence user agent is able to publish presence
    information to a presence agent.  Using the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF),
    each presence publication contains full state, regardless of how much of that
    information has actually changed since the previous update.  As a consequence,
    updating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a considerable
    overhead and is therefore inefficient.  Especially with low bandwidth and high
    latency links, this can constitute a considerable burden to the system.  This
    memo defines a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constraints
    and increases transport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for
    publication of partial presence information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
