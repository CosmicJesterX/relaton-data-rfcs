abstract:
  content: This document is published by the RFC Editor to provide a summary of the
    current standards protocols (as of 18 February 2008). It lists those official
    protocol standards, Best Current Practice, and Experimental RFCs that have not
    been obsoleted; it is not a complete index to the RFC series. Newly published
    RFCs and RFCs whose status has changed are starred. For an up-to-date list, see
    http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfcxx00.html, which is updated daily. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
