abstract:
  content: This document describes issues associated with providing multi-tenancy
    in large data center networks and how these issues may be addressed using an overlay-based
    network virtualization approach.  A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation
    so that one tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another requirement
    is address space isolation so that different tenants can use the same address
    space within different virtual networks.  Traffic and address space isolation
    is achieved by assigning one or more virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic
    within a virtual network can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled
    fashion (e.g., via a configured router and/or a security gateway).  Additional
    functionality is required to provision virtual networks, associating a virtual
    machine's network interface(s) with the appropriate virtual network and maintaining
    that association as the virtual machine is activated, migrated, and/or deactivated.  Use
    of an overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large network infrastructures.
