abstract:
  content: This RFC specifies a new host table format applicable to both ARPANET and
    Internet needs.  In addition to host name to host address translation and selected
    protocol information, we have also included network and gateway name to address
    correspondence, and host operating system information.  This RFC obsoletes the
    host table described in RFC 608.
