abstract:
  content: 'This document presents a base YANG Data model for the management of Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols that use connectionless communications.
    The data model is defined using the YANG data modeling language, as specified
    in RFC 7950. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs
    for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication. The base model presented
    here can be extended to include technology-specific details. There are two key
    benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols.
    Second, it supports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions
    at the same level or different levels through a unified interface) as well as
    interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level through
    a unified interface).'
