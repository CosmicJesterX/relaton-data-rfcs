abstract:
- content: This document describes the registration of the Multipurpose Internet Mail
    Extensions (MIME) sub-types to be used by the international astronomical community
    for the interchange of Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files.  The encoding
    is defined by the published FITS standard documents.  The FITS format has been
    in use since 1979, and almost all data from astronomical observations are interchanged
    by using FITS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
