abstract:
  content: This text describes evolving networking technology within residential home
    networks with increasing numbers of devices and a trend towards increased internal
    routing.  The goal of this document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based
    home networking, describing the associated principles, considerations, and requirements.  The
    text briefly highlights specific implications of the introduction of IPv6 for
    home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and suggests how
    standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.  The
    architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional
    functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed
    and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.  There are no recommendations
    in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.
