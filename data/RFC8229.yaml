abstract:
  content: This document describes a method to transport Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    (IKE) and IPsec packets over a TCP connection for traversing network middleboxes
    that may block IKE negotiation over UDP.  This method, referred to as "TCP encapsulation",
    involves sending both IKE packets for Security Association establishment and Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) packets over a TCP connection.  This method is intended
    to be used as a fallback option when IKE cannot be negotiated over UDP.
