abstract:
- content: This document describes how to extend the Forwarding and Control Element
    Separation (ForCES) Logical Functional Block (LFB) topology across Forwarding
    Elements (FEs) by defining the inter-FE LFB class.  The inter-FE LFB class provides
    the ability to pass data and metadata across FEs without needing any changes to
    the ForCES specification.  The document focuses on Ethernet transport.
