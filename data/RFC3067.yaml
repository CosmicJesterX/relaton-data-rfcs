abstract:
- content: The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format is to
    define a common data format for the description, archiving and exchange of information
    about incidents between CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams) (including
    alert, incident in investigation, archiving, statistics, reporting, etc.).  This
    document describes the high-level requirements for such a description and exchange
    format, including the reasons for those requirements.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
