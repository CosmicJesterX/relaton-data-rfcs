abstract:
  content: Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) uses a Rendezvous
    Point (RP) and shared trees to forward multicast packets from new sources.  Once
    Last-Hop Routers (LHRs) receive packets from a new source, they may join the Shortest
    Path Tree (SPT) for the source for optimal forwarding.  This document defines
    a new mechanism that provides a way to support PIM-SM without the need for PIM
    registers, RPs, or shared trees.  Multicast source information is flooded throughout
    the multicast domain using a new generic PIM Flooding Mechanism (PFM).  This allows
    LHRs to learn about new sources without receiving initial data packets.
