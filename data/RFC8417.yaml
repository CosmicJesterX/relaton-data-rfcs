abstract:
  content: This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure.  A
    SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject.  These
    statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security
    subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token
    on behalf of a subject.  This specification is intended to enable representing
    security- and identity-related events.  A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which
    can be optionally signed and/or encrypted.  SETs can be distributed via protocols
    such as HTTP.
