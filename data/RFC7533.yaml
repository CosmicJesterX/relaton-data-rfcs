abstract:
- content: This document describes the administration protocol for a federated file
    system (FedFS) that enables file access and namespace traversal across collections
    of independently administered fileservers.  The protocol specifies a set of interfaces
    by which fileservers with different administrators can form a fileserver federation
    that provides a namespace composed of the file systems physically hosted on and
    exported by the constituent fileservers.
