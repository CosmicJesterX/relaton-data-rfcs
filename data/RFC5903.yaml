abstract:
- content: This document describes three Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups
    for use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2
    (IKEv2) protocols in addition to previously defined groups.  These groups are
    based on modular arithmetic rather than binary arithmetic.  These groups are defined
    to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards, particularly
    NIST standards.  In addition, the curves defined here can provide more efficient
    implementation than previously defined ECC groups.  This document obsoletes RFC
    4753.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.
