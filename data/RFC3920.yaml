abstract:
  content: This memo defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (XMPP), a protocol for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements
    in order to exchange structured information in close to real time between any
    two network endpoints.  While XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework
    for exchanging XML data, it is used mainly for the purpose of building instant
    messaging and presence applications that meet the requirements of RFC 2779. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
