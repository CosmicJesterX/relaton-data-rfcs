abstract:
  content: This document provides some analysis of threats against the Geopriv protocol
    architecture.  It focuses on protocol threats, threats that result from the storage
    of data by entities in the architecture, and threats posed by the abuse of information
    yielded by Geopriv.  Some security properties that meet these threats are enumerated
    as a reference for Geopriv requirements.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
