abstract:
- content: The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of the
    applicability of the pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header (ACH). RFC 5586
    defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be carried in messages on the G-ACh
    by placing them in the ACH between the fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.
    These TLVs are called ACH TLVs No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an
    ACH TLV. Furthermore, it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces
    significant problems to the fast path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to
    be processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is undesirable. This
    document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the associated registry.
