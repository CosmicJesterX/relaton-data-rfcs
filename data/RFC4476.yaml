abstract:
  content: This document describes one certificate extension that explicitly states
    the Attribute Certificate Policies (ACPs) that apply to a given Attribute Certificate
    (AC).  The goal of this document is to allow relying parties to perform an additional
    test when validating an AC, i.e., to assess whether a given AC carrying some attributes
    can be accepted on the basis of references to one or more specific ACPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
