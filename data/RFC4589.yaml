abstract:
- content: This document creates a registry for describing the types of places a human
    or end system might be found.  The registry is then referenced by other protocols
    that need a common set of location terms as protocol constants.  Examples of location
    terms defined in this document include aircraft, office, and train station. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
