abstract:
  content: This document describes a set of practices for operating the DNS with security
    extensions (DNSSEC). The target audience is zone administrators deploying DNSSEC.
    The document discusses operational aspects of using keys and signatures in the
    DNS. It discusses issues of key generation, key storage, signature generation,
    key rollover, and related policies. This document obsoletes RFC 4641, as it covers
    more operational ground and gives more up-to-date requirements with respect to
    key sizes and the DNSSEC operations.
