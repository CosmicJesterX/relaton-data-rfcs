abstract:
- content: The ability to change protocols depends on exercising the extension and
    version-negotiation mechanisms that support change.  This document explores how
    regular use of new protocol features can ensure that it remains possible to deploy
    changes to a protocol.  Examples are given where lack of use caused changes to
    be more difficult or costly.
