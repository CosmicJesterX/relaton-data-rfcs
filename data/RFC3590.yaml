abstract:
  content: It has come to light that there is an issue with the selection of a suitable
    IPv6 source address for Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) messages when a node
    is performing stateless address autoconfiguration.  This document is intended
    to clarify the rules on selecting an IPv6 address to use for MLD messages. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
