abstract:
  content: This document provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to
    the control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs). In particular, it
    examines Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) of optical paths. This document
    focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are common
    across different WSON environments; as such, it does not address optical impairments
    in any depth. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
