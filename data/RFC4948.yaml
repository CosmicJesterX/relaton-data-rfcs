abstract:
  content: This document reports the outcome of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB) on Unwanted Internet Traffic.  The workshop was held on March 9-10,
    2006 at USC/ISI in Marina del Rey, CA, USA.  The primary goal of the workshop
    was to foster interchange between the operator, standards, and research communities
    on the topic of unwanted traffic, as manifested in, for example, Distributed Denial
    of Service (DDoS) attacks, spam, and phishing, to gain understandings on the ultimate
    sources of these unwanted traffic, and to assess their impact and the effectiveness
    of existing solutions.  It was also a goal of the workshop to identify engineering
    and research topics that could be undertaken by the IAB, the IETF, the IRTF, and
    the network research and development community at large to develop effective countermeasures
    against the unwanted traffic.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
