abstract:
- content: A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash function.  One
    popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a block cipher in conjunction
    with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode of operation.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm,
    while secure for messages of a pre-selected fixed length, has been shown to be
    insecure across messages of varying lengths such as the type found in typical
    IP datagrams.  This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode with a set of extensions
    to overcome this limitation.  This new algorithm is named AES-XCBC-MAC-96. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
