abstract:
  content: A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called
    segments, by prepending the packet with a list of segment identifiers (SIDs).
    A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based. SR segments
    allow steering a flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
    per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain. This document describes
    an extension to Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) for advertisement
    of BGP Peering Segments along with their BGP peering node information so that
    efficient BGP Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) policies and strategies can be computed
    based on Segment Routing.
