abstract:
  content: This document is a framework for how data plane protocols can be applied
    to operations and maintenance procedures for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS).  The
    document is structured to outline how Operations and Management (OAM) functionality
    can be used to assist in fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security
    management, commonly known by the acronym FCAPS.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
