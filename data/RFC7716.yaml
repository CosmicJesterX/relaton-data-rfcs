abstract:
  content: RFCs 6513, 6514, and others describe protocols and procedures that a Service
    Provider (SP) may deploy in order to offer Multicast Virtual Private Network (Multicast
    VPN or MVPN) service to its customers.  Some of these procedures use BGP to distribute
    VPN-specific multicast routing information across a backbone network.  With a
    small number of relatively minor modifications, the same BGP procedures can also
    be used to distribute multicast routing information that is not specific to any
    VPN.  Multicast that is outside the context of a VPN is known as "Global Table
    Multicast", or sometimes simply as "Internet multicast".  In this document, we
    describe the modifications that are needed to use the BGP-MVPN procedures for
    Global Table Multicast.
