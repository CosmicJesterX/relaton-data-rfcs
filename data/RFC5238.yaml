abstract:
  content: This document specifies the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    over the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DTLS provides communications
    privacy for applications that use datagram transport protocols and allows client/server
    applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping
    and detect tampering or message forgery.  DCCP is a transport protocol that provides
    a congestion-controlled unreliable datagram service. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
