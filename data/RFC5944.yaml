abstract:
- content: This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing
    of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified
    by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While
    situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address,
    which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The
    protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The
    home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the
    care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then
    delivered to the mobile node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
