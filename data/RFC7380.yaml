abstract:
  content: An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used in the
    transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/multicast MPEG2 TS over
    RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document defines an RTP Control
    Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) block that allows the reporting of MPEG2
    TS decodability statistics metrics related to transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.  The
    metrics specified in the RTCP XR block are related to Program Specific Information
    (PSI) carried in MPEG TS.
