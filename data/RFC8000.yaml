abstract:
  content: This document presents requirements for the deployment of the NFSv4 protocols
    for the construction of an NFSv4 file namespace in environments with multiple
    NFSv4 Domains.  To participate in an NFSv4 multi-domain file namespace, the server
    must offer a multi-domain-capable file system and support RPCSEC_GSS for user
    authentication.  In most instances, the server must also support identity-mapping
    services.
