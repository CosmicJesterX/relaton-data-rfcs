abstract:
  content: This document specifies IPv4 compatibility mechanisms that can be implemented
    by IPv6 hosts and routers. Two mechanisms are specified, dual stack and configured
    tunneling. Dual stack implies providing complete implementations of both versions
    of the Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), and configured tunneling provides a
    means to carry IPv6 packets over unmodified IPv4 routing infrastructures. This
    document obsoletes RFC 2893. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
