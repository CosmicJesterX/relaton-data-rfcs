abstract:
  content: This document describes how a Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) performs a planned rollover of its key pair.  This
    document also notes the implications of this key rollover procedure for relying
    parties (RPs).  In general, RPs are expected to maintain a local cache of the
    objects that have been published in the RPKI repository, and thus the way in which
    a CA performs key rollover impacts RPs.  This memo documents an Internet Best
    Current Practice.
