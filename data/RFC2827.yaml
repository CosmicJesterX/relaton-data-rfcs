abstract:
- content: This paper discusses a simple, effective, and straightforward method for
    using ingress traffic filtering to prohibit DoS (Denial of Service) attacks which
    use forged IP addresses to be propagated from 'behind' an Internet Service Provider's
    (ISP) aggregation point.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
