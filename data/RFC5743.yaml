abstract:
- content: This memo defines the publication stream for RFCs from the Internet Research
    Task Force.  Most documents undergoing this process will come from IRTF Research
    Groups, and it is expected that they will be published as Informational or Experimental
    RFCs by the RFC Editor.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
