abstract:
  content: This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  One of the
    services frequently neglected in computer network design is a high-quality, time-of-day
    clock capable of generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to
    one-way network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress
    of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring network performance
    and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock service design will be described
    and its performance assessed.  This design has been incorporated as an integral
    part of the network routing and control protocols of the Distributed Computer
    Network (DCnet) architecture.
