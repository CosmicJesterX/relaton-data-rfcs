abstract:
  content: The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol describes an XML- based
    protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or civic location information
    to service contact Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). LoST servers can be located
    anywhere, but a placement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network,
    is desirable. In disaster situations with intermittent network connectivity, such
    a LoST server placement provides benefits regarding the resiliency of emergency
    service communication. This document describes how a LoST client can discover
    a LoST server using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
