abstract:
  content: This RFC proposes simple rules for broadcasting Internet datagrams on local
    networks that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts, and for how gateways
    should handle them.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
