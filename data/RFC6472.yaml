abstract:
  content: This document recommends against the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET
    types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation
    of BGP and to make the semantics of the originator of a route more clear.  This
    will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of ongoing work
    in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.  This memo documents an Internet
    Best Current Practice.
