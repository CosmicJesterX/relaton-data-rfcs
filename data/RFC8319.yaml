abstract:
  content: The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol specifies the maximum time allowed
    between sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements (RAs) from a router
    interface as well as the maximum router lifetime. It also allows the limits to
    be overridden by documents that are specific to the link layer. This document
    allows for overriding these values on a per-link basis. This document specifies
    updates to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (RFC 4861) to increase the maximum
    time allowed between sending unsolicited multicast RAs from a router interface
    as well as to increase the maximum router lifetime.
