abstract:
- content: Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the need
    for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for
    constrained devices. Ensuring that devices function and remain secure over their
    service lifetime requires such an update mechanism to fix vulnerabilities, update
    configuration settings, and add new functionality. One component of such a firmware
    update is a concise and machine-processable metadata document, or manifest, that
    describes the firmware image(s) and offers appropriate protection. This document
    describes the information that must be present in the manifest.
