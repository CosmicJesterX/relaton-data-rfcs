abstract:
- content: RSVP signaling messages typically include policy data objects, which in
    turn contain policy elements.  Policy elements may describe user and/or application
    information, which may be used by RSVP aware network elements to apply appropriate
    policy decisions to a traffic flow.  This memo details the usage of policy elements
    that provide application information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
