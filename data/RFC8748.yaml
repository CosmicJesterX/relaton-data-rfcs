abstract:
  content: Given the expansion of the DNS namespace and the proliferation of novel
    business models, it is desirable to provide a method for Extensible Provisioning
    Protocol (EPP) clients to query EPP servers for the fees and credits associated
    with various billable transactions and provide expected fees and credits for certain
    commands and objects.  This document describes an EPP extension mapping for registry
    fees.
