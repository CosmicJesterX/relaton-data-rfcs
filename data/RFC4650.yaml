abstract:
- content: This document describes a lightweight point-to-point key management protocol
    variant for the multimedia Internet keying (MIKEY) protocol MIKEY, as defined
    in RFC 3830.  In particular, this variant deploys the classic Diffie-Hellman key
    agreement protocol for key establishment featuring perfect forward secrecy in
    conjunction with a keyed hash message authentication code for achieving mutual
    authentication and message integrity of the key management messages exchanged.  This
    protocol addresses the security and performance constraints of multimedia key
    management in MIKEY. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
