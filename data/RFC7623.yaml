abstract:
  content: This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can
    be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC
    Advertisement routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-MAC) addresses via
    Provider Backbone MAC (B-MAC) address, provide client MAC address mobility using
    C-MAC aggregation, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows, offer
    per-site policies, and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology changes.  The
    combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN.
