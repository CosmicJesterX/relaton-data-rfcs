abstract:
- content: This memo describes a collection of multicast communication primitives
    integrated with a mechanism for handling process failure and recovery.  These
    primitives facilitate the implementation of fault-tolerant process groups, which
    can be used to provide distributed services in an environment subject to non-malicious
    crash failures.
