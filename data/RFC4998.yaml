    of data, including digitally signed data, in a common and reproducible way over
    a long and possibly undetermined period of time.  This document specifies the
    syntax and processing of an Evidence Record, a structure designed to support long-term
    non-repudiation of existence of data. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
