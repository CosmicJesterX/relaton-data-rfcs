abstract:
  content: This document describes a proposal for one form of a template for IETF
    patent disclosures and licensing declarations.  The optional use of this template
    is meant to simplify the process of such disclosures and licensing declarations
    and to assist disclosers in providing the necessary information to meet the obligations
    documented in RFC 3668.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
