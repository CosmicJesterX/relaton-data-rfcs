abstract:
  content: This document specifies a mechanism that enables a Routing Protocol for
    Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) router to measure the aggregated values of
    given routing metrics along an existing route towards another RPL router, thereby
    allowing the router to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery of a better
    route.
