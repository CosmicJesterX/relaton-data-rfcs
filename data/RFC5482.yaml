abstract:
  content: The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged
    before a connection is forcefully closed.  It is a local, per-connection parameter.  This
    document specifies a new TCP option -- the TCP User Timeout Option -- that allows
    one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout value.  This
    information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt its
    user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on both ends of a TCP
    connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing
    the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients that
    they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without connectivity.
