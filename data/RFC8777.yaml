abstract:
  content: This document updates RFC 7450, "Automatic Multicast Tunneling" (or AMT),
    by modifying the relay discovery process.  A new DNS resource record named AMTRELAY
    is defined for publishing AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels.  The
    reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY
    resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward
    multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other extensions and clarifications
    to the relay discovery process are also defined.
