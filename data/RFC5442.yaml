abstract:
  content: This document specifies the architecture for mobile email, as described
    by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), using Internet Mail protocols.  This architecture
    was an important consideration for much of the work of the LEMONADE (Enhancements
    to Internet email to Support Diverse Service Environments) working group in the
    IETF.  This document also describes how the LEMONADE architecture meets OMA's
    requirements for their Mobile Email (MEM) service.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
