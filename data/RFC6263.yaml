abstract:
- content: This document lists the different mechanisms that enable applications using
    the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) to
    keep their RTP Network Address Translator (NAT) mappings alive.  It also makes
    a recommendation for a preferred mechanism.  This document is not applicable to
    Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) agents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
