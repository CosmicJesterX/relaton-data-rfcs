abstract:
- content: The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) systems. A PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the
    processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN
    and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the Label Switched Path
    (LSP) can be calculated/set up/initiated and the label-forwarding entries can
    also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device along
    the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This
    document specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for provisioning
    labels along the path of the static LSP.
