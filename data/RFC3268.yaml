abstract:
- content: This document proposes several new ciphersuites.  At present, the symmetric
    ciphers supported by Transport Layer Security (TLS) are RC2, RC4, International
    Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Data Encryption Standard (DES), and triple DES.  The
    protocol would be enhanced by the addition of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    ciphersuites. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
