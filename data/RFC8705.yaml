abstract:
  content: This document describes OAuth client authentication and certificate-bound
    access and refresh tokens using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
    with X.509 certificates.  OAuth clients are provided a mechanism for authentication
    to the authorization server using mutual TLS, based on either self-signed certificates
    or public key infrastructure (PKI).  OAuth authorization servers are provided
    a mechanism for binding access tokens to a client's mutual-TLS certificate, and
    OAuth protected resources are provided a method for ensuring that such an access
    token presented to it was issued to the client presenting the token.
