abstract:
  content: RFB ("remote framebuffer") is a simple protocol for remote access to graphical
    user interfaces that allows a client to view and control a window system on another
    computer.  Because it works at the framebuffer level, RFB is applicable to all
    windowing systems and applications.  This document describes the protocol used
    to communicate between an RFB client and RFB server.  RFB is the protocol used
    in VNC.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
