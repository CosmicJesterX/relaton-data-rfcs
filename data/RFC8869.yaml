abstract:
- content: The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a common transport choice for
    interactive multimedia communication applications.  The performance of these applications
    typically depends on a well-functioning congestion control algorithm.  To ensure
    a seamless and robust user experience, a well-designed RTP-based congestion control
    algorithm should work well across all access network types.  This document describes
    test cases for evaluating performances of candidate congestion control algorithms
    over cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
