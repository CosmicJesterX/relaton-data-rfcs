abstract:
  content: This document describes the certificate policy for a Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) used to support attestations about Internet Number Resource (INR) holdings.  Each
    organization that distributes IP addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers to
    an organization will, in parallel, issue a (public key) certificate reflecting
    this distribution.  These certificates will enable verification that the resources
    indicated in the certificate have been distributed to the holder of the associated
    private key and that this organization is the current, unique holder of these
    resources.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.
