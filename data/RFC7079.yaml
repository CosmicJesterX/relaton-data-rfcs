abstract:
  content: The IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) working group has defined
    many encapsulations of various layer 1 and layer 2 service- specific PDUs and
    circuit data.  In most of these encapsulations, use of the Pseudowire (PW) Control
    Word is required.  However, there are several encapsulations for which the Control
    Word is optional, and this optionality has been seen in practice to possibly introduce
    interoperability concerns between multiple implementations of those encapsulations.  This
    survey of the Pseudowire / Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) user
    community was conducted to determine implementation trends and the possibility
    of always mandating the Control Word.
