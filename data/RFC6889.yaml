abstract:
  content: Due to specific problems, Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation
    (NAT-PT) was deprecated by the IETF as a mechanism to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  Since
    then, new efforts have been undertaken within IETF to standardize alternative
    mechanisms to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  This document analyzes to what extent
    the new stateful translation mechanisms avoid the problems that caused the IETF
    to deprecate NAT-PT.
