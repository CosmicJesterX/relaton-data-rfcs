abstract:
- content: This specification defines a mechanism enabling web sites to declare themselves
    accessible only via secure connections and/or for users to be able to direct their
    user agent(s) to interact with given sites only over secure connections.  This
    overall policy is referred to as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).  The policy
    is declared by web sites via the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header
    field and/or by other means, such as user agent configuration, for example. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
