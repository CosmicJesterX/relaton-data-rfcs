abstract:
  content: This memo provides an update and clarification to RFC 1816.  This document
    describes the registration policies for the top-level domain ".GOV".  The purpose
    of the domain is to provide naming conventions that identify US Federal government
    agencies in order to facilitate access to their electronic resources.  This memo
    provides guidance for registrations by Federal Agencies that avoids name duplication
    and facilitates responsiveness to the public.  It restricts registrations to coincide
    with the approved structure of the US government and the advice of its Chief Information
    Officers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
    does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
