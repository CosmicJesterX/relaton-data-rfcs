abstract:
  content: Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is widely used throughout the IETF
    Security Area and has been for many years.  Some specifications were written using
    a now deprecated version of ASN.1 and some were written using the current version
    of ASN.1.  Not all ASN.1 compilers support both older and current syntax.  This
    document is intended to provide guidance to specification authors and to implementers
    converting ASN.1 modules from one version of ASN.1 to another version without
    causing changes to the "bits on the wire".  This document does not provide a comprehensive
    tutorial of any version of ASN.1.  Instead, it addresses ASN.1 features that are
    used in IETF Security Area specifications with a focus on items that vary with
    the ASN.1 version.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
