abstract:
- content: This document describes the problem space and solution requirements for
    developing an IP Security Policy (IPSP) configuration and management framework.  The
    IPSP architecture provides a scalable, decentralized framework for managing, discovering
    and negotiating the host and network security policies that govern access, authorization,
    authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and other IP Security properties.  This
    document highlights such architectural components and presents their functional
    requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
