abstract:
  content: This document describes a mechanism that allows a single router to share
    one or more circuits among multiple Intermediate System to Intermediate System
    (IS-IS) routing protocol instances. Multiple instances allow the isolation of
    resources associated with each instance. Routers will form instance-specific adjacencies.
    Each instance can support multiple topologies. Each topology has a unique Link
    State Database (LSDB). Each Protocol Data Unit (PDU) will contain a new Type-Length-Value
    (TLV) identifying the instance and the topology (or topologies) to which the PDU
    belongs.
