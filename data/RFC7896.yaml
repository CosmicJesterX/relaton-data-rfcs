abstract:
- content: The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) enables communications
    between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs. RFC 5440
    defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to specify network elements to be traversed
    in the computed path. The specification does not specify if the IRO contains an
    ordered or unordered list of subobjects. During recent discussions, it was determined
    that there was a need to define a standard representation to ensure interoperability.
    It was also noted that there is a benefit in the handling of an attribute of the
    IRO's subobject, the L bit. This document updates RFC 5440 regarding the IRO specification.
