abstract:
- content: TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed
    a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6
    applications.  But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and
    this memo describes these changes.  These include a new socket address structure
    to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket
    options.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
