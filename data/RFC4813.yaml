abstract:
  content: OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.  OSPF
    routers exchange information on a link using packets that follow a well-defined
    format.  The format of OSPF packets is not flexible enough to enable applications
    to exchange arbitrary data, which may be necessary in certain situations.  This
    memo describes a vendor-specific, backward-compatible technique to perform link-local
    signaling, i.e., exchange arbitrary data on a link.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.
