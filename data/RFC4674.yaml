abstract:
- content: This document presents a set of requirements for a Path Computation Element
    (PCE) discovery mechanism that would allow a Path Computation Client (PCC) to
    discover dynamically and automatically a set of PCEs along with certain information
    relevant for PCE selection.  It is intended that solutions that specify procedures
    and protocols or extensions to existing protocols for such PCE discovery satisfy
    these requirements.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
