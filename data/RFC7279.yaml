abstract:
  content: In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role in the IP
    stack and some guidelines for future use. This document is motivated by concerns
    about lack of clarity concerning when to add new Internet Control Message Protocol
    (ICMP) types and/or codes. These concerns have highlighted a need to describe
    policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable and when it is not.
