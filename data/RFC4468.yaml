abstract:
  content: The submission profile of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) provides
    a standard way for an email client to submit a complete message for delivery.  This
    specification extends the submission profile by adding a new BURL command that
    can be used to fetch submission data from an Internet Message Access Protocol
    (IMAP) server.  This permits a mail client to inject content from an IMAP server
    into the SMTP infrastructure without downloading it to the client and uploading
    it back to the server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
