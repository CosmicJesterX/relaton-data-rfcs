abstract:
- content: This document defines extensions to the Kerberos protocol to allow a Kerberos
    client to securely communicate with a Kerberos application service without revealing
    its identity, or without revealing more than its Kerberos realm.  It also defines
    extensions that allow a Kerberos client to obtain anonymous credentials without
    revealing its identity to the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).  This document
    updates RFCs 4120, 4121, and 4556.  This document obsoletes RFC 6112 and reclassifies
    that document as Historic.  RFC 6112 contained errors, and the protocol described
    in that specification is not interoperable with any known implementation.  This
    specification describes a protocol that interoperates with multiple implementations.
