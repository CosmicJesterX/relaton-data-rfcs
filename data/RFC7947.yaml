abstract:
  content: This document outlines a specification for multilateral interconnections
    at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).  Multilateral interconnection is a method
    of exchanging routing information among three or more External BGP (EBGP) speakers
    using a single intermediate broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route
    servers are typically used on shared access media networks, such as IXPs, to facilitate
    simplified interconnection among multiple Internet routers.
