abstract:
  content: 'This document specifies a method for exchanging IPv6 routing information
    using the IS-IS routing protocol.  The described method utilizes two new TLVs:
    a reachability TLV and an interface address TLV to distribute the necessary IPv6
    information throughout a routing domain.  Using this method, one can route IPv6
    along with IPv4 and OSI using a single intra-domain routing protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
