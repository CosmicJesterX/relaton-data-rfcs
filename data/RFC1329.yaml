abstract:
- content: In this document an idea is submitted how IP and ARP can be used on inhomogeneous
    FDDI networks (FDDI networks with single MAC and dual MAC stations) by introducing
    a new protocol layer in the protocol suite of the dual MAC stations.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet
    standard.
