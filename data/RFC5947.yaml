abstract:
  content: This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration mechanism
    for multiple addresses of record (AORs), the mechanism being suitable for deployment
    by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to medium sized
    Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs).  The requirements are for a solution that can,
    as a minimum, support AORs based on E.164 numbers.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
