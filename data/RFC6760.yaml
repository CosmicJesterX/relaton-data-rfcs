abstract:
  content: One of the goals of the authors of Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-Based Service
    Discovery (DNS-SD) was to retire AppleTalk and the AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol
    (NBP) and to replace them with an IP-based solution.  This document presents a
    brief overview of the capabilities of AppleTalk NBP and outlines the properties
    required of an IP-based replacement.
