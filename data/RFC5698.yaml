abstract:
  content: Since cryptographic algorithms can become weak over the years, it is necessary
    to evaluate their security suitability.  When signing or verifying data, or when
    encrypting or decrypting data, these evaluations must be considered.  This document
    specifies a data structure that enables an automated analysis of the security
    suitability of a given cryptographic algorithm at a given point of time, which
    may be in the past, the present, or the future. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
