abstract:
- content: 'This document provides extensions to Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS) signaling for control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).  Such
    extensions are applicable in WSONs under a number of conditions including: (a)
    when optional processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at
    specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured to accept
    an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must be configured
    to output an optical signal with specific attributes.  This document provides
    mechanisms to support distributed wavelength assignment with a choice of distributed
    wavelength assignment algorithms.'
