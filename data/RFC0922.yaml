abstract:
  content: We propose simple rules for broadcasting Internet datagrams on local networks
    that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts, and for how gateways should
    handle them.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
