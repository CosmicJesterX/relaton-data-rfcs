abstract:
- content: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous specifications
    that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be difficult to locate the right
    document, or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  This
    specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot
    of the specifications under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups
    them into categories.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
