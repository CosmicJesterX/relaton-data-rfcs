abstract:
  content: Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform the
    network about expected congestion based on congestion feedback from previous packets
    in the same flow.  This document describes the necessary modifications to use
    ConEx with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
