abstract:
  content: In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Certificate Authorities
    (CAs) publish certificates, including end-entity certificates, Certificate Revocation
    Lists (CRLs), and RPKI signed objects to repositories.  Relying Parties retrieve
    the published information from those repositories.  This document specifies a
    new RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) for this purpose.  RRDP was specifically
    designed for scaling.  It relies on an Update Notification File which lists the
    current Snapshot and Delta Files that can be retrieved using HTTPS (HTTP over
    Transport Layer Security (TLS)), and it enables the use of Content Distribution
    Networks (CDNs) or other caching infrastructures for the retrieval of these files.
