abstract:
  content: The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to cryptographic
    algorithms deployed widely today.  The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version
    2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing
    VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer
    is available.  It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure
    key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.  To
    address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2
    to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys.
