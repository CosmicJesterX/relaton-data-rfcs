abstract:
  content: Currently, channel bindings are implemented using an MD5 hash in the Kerberos
    Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API)
    mechanism (RFC 4121).  This document updates RFC 4121 to allow channel bindings
    using algorithms negotiated based on Kerberos crypto framework as defined in RFC
    3961.  In addition, because this update makes use of the last extensible field
    in the Kerberos client-server exchange message, extensions are defined to allow
    future protocol extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
