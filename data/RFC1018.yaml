abstract:
  content: This memo is a discussion of some of the ideas expressed in RFC-1016 on
    Source Quench.  This memo introduces the distinction of the cause of congestion
    in a gateway between the effects of "Funneling" and "Mismatch".  It is offered
    in the same spirit as RFC-1016; to stimulate discussion.  The opinions offered
    are personal, not corporate, opinions.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
