abstract:
  content: This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic location.  This
    format is designed for use with Presence Information Data Format Location Object
    (PIDF-LO) documents and replaces the civic location format in RFC 4119.  The format
    is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements
    based on the civic types defined for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP),
    and adds a hierarchy to address complex road identity schemes.  The format also
    includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of elements
    where appropriate. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
