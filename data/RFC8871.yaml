abstract:
  content: This document describes a solution framework for ensuring that media confidentiality
    and integrity are maintained end to end within the context of a switched conferencing
    environment where Media Distributors are not trusted with the end-to-end media
    encryption keys.  The solution builds upon existing security mechanisms defined
    for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).
