abstract:
- content: Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is a suite of protocol
    extensions to MPLS to make it generally applicable, to include, for example, control
    of non packet-based switching, and particularly, optical switching.  One consideration
    is to use GMPLS protocols to upgrade the control plane of optical transport networks.  This
    document illustrates this process by describing those extensions to GMPLS protocols
    that are aimed at controlling Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or Synchronous
    Optical Networking (SONET) networks.  SDH/SONET networks make good examples of
    this process for a variety of reasons.  This document highlights extensions to
    GMPLS-related routing protocols to disseminate information needed in transport
    path computation and network operations, together with (G)MPLS protocol extensions
    required for the provisioning of transport circuits.  New capabilities that an
    GMPLS control plane would bring to SDH/SONET networks, such as new restoration
    methods and multi-layer circuit establishment, are also discussed.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
