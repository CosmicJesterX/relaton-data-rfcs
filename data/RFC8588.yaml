abstract:
- content: This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), which is
    a token object that conveys cryptographically signed information about the participants
    involved in communications.  The extension is defined based on the "Signature-based
    Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN)" specification by the ATIS/SIP
    Forum IP-NNI Task Group.  It provides both (1) a specific set of levels of confidence
    in the correctness of the originating identity of a call originated in a SIP-based
    telephone network as well as (2) an identifier that allows the Service Provider
    (SP) to uniquely identify the origin of the call within its network.
