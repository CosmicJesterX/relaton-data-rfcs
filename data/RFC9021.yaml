abstract:
- content: This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital Signature
    Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing and
    Encryption (COSE) syntax. WalnutDSA is a lightweight, quantum-resistant signature
    scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography with implementation and computational
    efficiency of signature verification in constrained environments, even on 8- and
    16-bit platforms. The goal of this publication is to document a way to use the
    lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature algorithm in COSE in a way
    that would allow multiple developers to build compatible implementations. As of
    this publication, the security properties of WalnutDSA have not been evaluated
    by the IETF and its use has not been endorsed by the IETF. WalnutDSA and the Walnut
    Digital Signature Algorithm are trademarks of Veridify Security Inc.
