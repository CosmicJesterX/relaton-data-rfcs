abstract:
  content: This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and 916, and
    suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same needs addressed in those
    memos.  The stated need is reliable communication between two programs over a
    full-duplex, point-to-point communication link, and in particular the RFCs address
    the need for such communication over an asynchronous link at relatively low speeds.  The
    suggested protocol uses the methods of existing national and international data
    link layer standards.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
