abstract:
  content: This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative-acknowledgment
    (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol.  This protocol is designed
    to provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over
    generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective,
    negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional
    protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal "a priori" coordination
    among senders and receivers.  A congestion control scheme is specified to allow
    the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport
    protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It is capable of operating
    with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric
    connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers.  The
    protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications
    or possibly other higher level transport protocols to utilize its service in different
    ways.  The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable
    multicast transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.  This memo defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
