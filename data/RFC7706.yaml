abstract:
- content: Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server.  Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to
    prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root servers by third parties.  Such
    resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent observation of
    requests by running a copy of the full root zone on a loopback address (such as
    127.0.0.1).  This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the
    root zone that does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS, at the cost of
    adding some operational fragility for the operator.
