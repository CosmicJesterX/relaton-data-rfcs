abstract:
- content: This document describes methods for performing LSP ping (specified in RFC
    4379) traceroute over MPLS tunnels and for traceroute of stitched MPLS Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs).  The techniques outlined in RFC 4379 are insufficient to perform
    traceroute Forwarding Equivalency Class (FEC) validation and path discovery for
    an LSP that goes over other MPLS tunnels or for a stitched LSP.  This document
    deprecates the Downstream Mapping TLV (defined in RFC 4379) in favor of a new
    TLV that, along with other procedures outlined in this document, can be used to
    trace such LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
