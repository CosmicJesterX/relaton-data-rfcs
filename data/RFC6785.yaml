abstract:
  content: Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle, plug
    into any point in the processing of an email message.  As defined in the base
    specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can
    plug into points in IMAP where messages are created or changed, adding the option
    of user-defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions,
    features such as notifications).  Because this requires future Sieve extensions
    to specify their interactions with this one, this document updates the base Sieve
    specification, RFC 5228. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
