abstract:
  content: The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital certificates.
    It is used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP) control
    packets. This document specifies the certificate parameter and the error signaling
    in case of a failed verification. Additionally, this document specifies the representations
    of Host Identity Tags (HITs) in X.509 version 3 (v3). The concrete use cases of
    certificates, including how certificates are obtained and requested and which
    actions are taken upon successful or failed verification, are specific to the
    scenario in which the certificates are used. Hence, the definition of these scenario-specific
    aspects is left to the documents that use the CERT parameter. This document updates
    RFC 7401 and obsoletes RFC 6253.
