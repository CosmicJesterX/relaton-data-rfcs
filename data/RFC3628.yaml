abstract:
  content: This document defines requirements for a baseline time-stamp policy for
    Time-Stamping Authorities (TSAs) issuing time-stamp tokens, supported by public
    key certificates, with an accuracy of one second or better.  A TSA may define
    its own policy which enhances the policy defined in this document.  Such a policy
    shall incorporate or further constrain the requirements identified in this document.
