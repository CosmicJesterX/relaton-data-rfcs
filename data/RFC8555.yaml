abstract:
- content: Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used for
    a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain
    names.  Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify
    that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s)
    in the certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection
    of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant
    can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.  The
    protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions,
    such as certificate revocation.
