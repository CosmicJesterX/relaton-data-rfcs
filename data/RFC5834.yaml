abstract:
  content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols.  In particular, it describes managed objects
    for modeling the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol
    for IEEE 802.11 wireless binding.  This MIB module is presented as a basis for
    future work on the management of the CAPWAP protocol using the Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP).  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.
