abstract:
  content: Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses
    using a combination of locally available information and information advertised
    by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface
    identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface
    identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface
    identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This
    document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for
    interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use
    of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface
    identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains
    an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global
    scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers
    and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in
    different transactions actually correspond to the same node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
