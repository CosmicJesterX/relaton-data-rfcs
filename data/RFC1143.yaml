abstract:
  content: This is RFC discusses an implementation approach to option negotiation
    in the Telnet protocol (RFC 854).  It does not propose any changes to the TELNET
    protocol.  Rather, it discusses the implementation of the protocol of one feature,
    only.  This is not a protocol specification.  This is an experimental method of
    implementing a protocol.
