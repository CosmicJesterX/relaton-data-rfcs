abstract:
- content: The IETF Datatracker tool needs to be enhanced to make it possible for
    Working Group (WG) Chairs to provide IETF participants with more information about
    the status and progression of WG documents than is currently possible. This document
    defines new states and status annotation tags that need to be added to the Datatracker
    to enable WG Chairs and their Delegates to track the status of Internet-Drafts
    (I-Ds) that are associated with their WGs. This document also describes the meaning
    of all previously implemented I-D states and substate annotation tags currently
    used by IETF Area Directors to indicate the status of I-Ds that have been sent
    to the IESG for evaluation and publication. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
