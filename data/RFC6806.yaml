abstract:
  content: This memo documents a method for a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
    to respond to client requests for Kerberos tickets when the client does not have
    detailed configuration information on the realms of users or services.  The KDC
    will handle requests for principals in other realms by returning either a referral
    error or a cross-realm Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) to another realm on the referral
    path.  The clients will use this referral information to reach the realm of the
    target principal and then receive the ticket.  This memo also provides a mechanism
    for verifying that a request has not been tampered with in transit.  This memo
    updates RFC 4120. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
