abstract:
- content: This document proposes an extension to Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication algorithm
    in addition to the already-documented authentication schemes, described in the
    base specification and RFC 5304. IS-IS is specified in International Standards
    Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support Internet Protocol version
    4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195. Although this document has been written specifically
    for using the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) construct along with the
    Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family of cryptographic hash functions, the method
    described in this document is generic and can be used to extend IS-IS to support
    any cryptographic hash function in the future. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
