abstract:
  content: In order to deploy a residential telephone service at very large scale
    across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements owned by different
    service providers to exchange trusted information that conveys customer-specific
    information and expectations about the parties involved in the call.  This document
    describes private extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC3261)
    for supporting the exchange of customer information and billing information between
    trusted entities in the PacketCable Distributed Call Signaling Architecture.  These
    extensions provide mechanisms for access network coordination to prevent theft
    of service, customer originated trace of harassing calls, support for operator
    services and emergency services, and support for various other regulatory issues.  The
    use of the extensions is only applicable within closed administrative domains,
    or among federations of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon policies
    where coordination of charging and other functions is required.
