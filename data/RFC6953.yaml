abstract:
  content: Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use but
    are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white
    space".  The concept of allowing additional transmissions (which may or may not
    be licensed) in white space is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new
    use.  This document includes the problem statement for the development of a protocol
    to access a database of white-space information followed by use cases and requirements
    for that protocol.  Finally, requirements associated with the protocol are presented.
