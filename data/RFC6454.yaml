abstract:
  content: This document defines the concept of an "origin", which is often used as
    the scope of authority or privilege by user agents.  Typically, user agents isolate
    content retrieved from different origins to prevent malicious web site operators
    from interfering with the operation of benign web sites.  In addition to outlining
    the principles that underlie the concept of origin, this document details how
    to determine the origin of a URI and how to serialize an origin into a string.  It
    also defines an HTTP header field, named "Origin", that indicates which origins
    are associated with an HTTP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
