abstract:
  content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it defines objects for managing Ethernet-like interfaces.  This memo obsoletes
    RFC 2665.  It updates that specification by including management information useful
    for the management of 10 Gigabit per second (Gb/s) Ethernet interfaces.
