abstract:
  content: The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows clients to synchronize to a time
    server using timestamped protocol messages.  To facilitate accurate timestamping,
    some implementations use hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the
    accurate transmission time into every outgoing NTP packet during transmission.  Since
    these packets are transported over UDP, the UDP Checksum field is then updated
    to reflect this modification.  This document proposes an extension field that
    includes a 2-octet Checksum Complement, allowing timestamping engines to reflect
    the checksum modification in the last 2 octets of the packet rather than in the
    UDP Checksum field.  The behavior defined in this document is interoperable with
    existing NTP implementations.
