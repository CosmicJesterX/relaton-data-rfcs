abstract:
- content: The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) does not allow secure
    peer authentication when using short credential strings, i.e., passwords.  Several
    proposals have been made to integrate password-authentication protocols into IKE.  This
    document provides an adaptation of Password Authenticated Connection Establishment
    (PACE) to the setting of IKEv2 and demonstrates the advantages of this integration.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
