abstract:
  content: The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is
    an HTTP-based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios
    easier to support via a standardized service.  Examples include, but are not limited
    to, enterprise-to-cloud service providers and inter-cloud scenarios.  The specification
    suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing
    specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying
    existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.  SCIM's intent is
    to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a
    common user schema, an extension model, and a service protocol defined by this
    document.
