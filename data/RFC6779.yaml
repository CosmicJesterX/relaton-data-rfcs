abstract:
- content: This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery
    Protocol (NHDP) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in this document,
    denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state, performance information, and notifications
    about NHDP.  This additional state and performance information is useful to troubleshoot
    problems and performance issues during neighbor discovery. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
