abstract:
  content: 'The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document
    defines the rules for encoding IPP operations, attributes, and values into the
    Internet MIME media type called "application/ipp".  It also defines the rules
    for transporting a message body whose Content-Type is "application/ipp" over HTTP
    and/or HTTPS.  The IPP data model and operation semantics are described in "Internet
    Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" (RFC 8011).'
