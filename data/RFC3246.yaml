abstract:
  content: This document defines a PHB (per-hop behavior) called Expedited Forwarding
    (EF).  The PHB is a basic building block in the Differentiated Services architecture.  EF
    is intended to provide a building block for low delay, low jitter and low loss
    services by ensuring that the EF aggregate is served at a certain configured rate.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 2598. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
