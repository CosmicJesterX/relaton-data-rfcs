abstract:
  content: This RFC is a proposed specification for the encoding of Class A IP addresses
    for use on ARPANET-style networks such as the Milnet and Arpanet, and for enhancements
    to the ARPANET AHIP Host Access Protocol (AHIP; formerly known as 1822).  These
    enhancements increase the size of the PSN field, allow ARPANET hosts to use logical
    names to address each other, allow for the communication of type-of-service information
    from the host to the PSN and enable the PSN to provide congestion feedback to
    the host on a connection basis.
