abstract:
  content: RFC 5727 defined several processes for the former Real-time Applications
    and Infrastructure (RAI) area.  These processes include the evolution of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related protocols, as well as the operation of the
    DISPATCH and SIPCORE working groups.  This document updates RFC 5727 to allow
    flexibility for the area and working group structure, while preserving the SIP
    change processes.  It also generalizes the DISPATCH working group processes so
    that they can be easily adopted by other working groups.
