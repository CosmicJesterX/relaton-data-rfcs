abstract:
  content: Every DNS security-aware resolver must have at least one Trust Anchor to
    use as the basis for validating responses from DNS signed zones.  For various
    reasons, most DNS security-aware resolvers are expected to have several Trust
    Anchors.  For some operations, manual monitoring and updating of Trust Anchors
    may be feasible, but many operations will require automated methods for updating
    Trust Anchors in their security-aware resolvers.  This document identifies the
    requirements that must be met by an automated DNS Trust Anchor rollover solution
    for security-aware DNS resolvers.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
