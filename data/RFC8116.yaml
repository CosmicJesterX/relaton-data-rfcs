abstract:
  content: This document analyzes common security threats to the Optimized Link State
    Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) and describes their potential impacts on Mobile
    Ad Hoc Network (MANET) operations.  It also analyzes which of these security vulnerabilities
    can be mitigated when using the mandatory-to-implement security mechanisms for
    OLSRv2 and how the vulnerabilities are mitigated.
