abstract:
  content: This document describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource records that
    cover a smaller range of names than called for by RFC 4034.  By generating and
    signing these records on demand, authoritative name servers can effectively stop
    the disclosure of zone contents otherwise made possible by walking the chain of
    NSEC records in a signed zone. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
