abstract:
- content: This RFC focuses discussion on the particular problems in the ARPA-Internet
    of low speed network interconnection with personal computers, and possible methods
    of solution.  None of the proposed solutions in this document are intended as
    standards for the ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus
    will emerge as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading eventually
    to the adoption of standards.
