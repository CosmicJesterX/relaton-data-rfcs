abstract:
- content: The ability for a node to specify a forwarding path, other than the normal
    shortest path, that a particular packet will traverse, benefits a number of network
    functions. Source-based routing mechanisms have previously been specified for
    network protocols but have not seen widespread adoption. In this context, the
    term "source" means "the point at which the explicit route is imposed"; therefore,
    it is not limited to the originator of the packet (i.e., the node imposing the
    explicit route may be the ingress node of an operator's network). This document
    outlines various use cases, with their requirements, that need to be taken into
    account by the Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture for unicast
    traffic. Multicast use cases and requirements are out of scope for this document.
