abstract:
- content: This document suggests some strategies for the combined use of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
    both in user-oriented clients and in deployed servers.  Such strategies, which
    mainly consist of configuration changes and minimal software modifications to
    existing clients and servers, aim to provide a single, full-featured, real-time
    communication service by using complementary subsets of features from SIP and
    from XMPP.  Typically, such subsets consist of telephony capabilities from SIP
    and instant messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP.  This document does
    not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP and, by intent,
    does not attempt to standardize "best current practices".  Instead, it merely
    aims to provide practical guidance to those who are interested in the combined
    use of SIP and XMPP for real-time communication.
