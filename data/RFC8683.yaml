abstract:
  content: 'This document describes how Network Address and Protocol Translation from
    IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64) (including 464XLAT) can be deployed in an
    IPv6 network -- whether it''s cellular ISP, broadband ISP, or enterprise -- and
    the possible optimizations.  This document also discusses issues to be considered
    when having IPv6-only connectivity, such as: a) DNS64, b) applications or devices
    that use literal IPv4 addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs, and c) IPv4-only hosts
    or applications.'
