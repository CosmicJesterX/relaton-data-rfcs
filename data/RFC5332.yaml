abstract:
- content: RFC 3032 established two data link layer codepoints for MPLS, used to distinguish
    whether the data link layer frame is carrying an MPLS unicast or an MPLS multicast
    packet. However, this usage was never deployed. This specification updates RFC
    3032 by redefining the meaning of these two codepoints. Both codepoints can now
    be used to carry multicast packets. The second codepoint (formerly the "multicast
    codepoint") is now to be used only on multiaccess media, and it is to mean "the
    top label of the following label stack is an upstream-assigned label". RFC 3032
    does not specify the destination address to be placed in the "MAC DA" (Medium
    Access Layer Destination Address) field of an ethernet frame that carries an MPLS
    multicast packet. This document provides that specification. This document updates
    RFC 3032 and RFC 4023. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
