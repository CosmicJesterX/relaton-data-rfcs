abstract:
- content: In Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) active-active access,
    a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check failure issue may occur when using the pseudo-nickname
    mechanism specified in RFC 7781.  This document describes a solution to resolve
    this RPF check failure issue through centralized replication.  All ingress Routing
    Bridges (RBridges) send Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic
    to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.  When the centralized
    node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets and forwards them to
    their destination RBridges using a distribution tree established per the TRILL
    base protocol (RFC 6325).  To avoid RPF check failure on an RBridge sitting between
    the ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, some change in the RPF
    calculation algorithm is required.  RPF checks on each RBridge MUST be calculated
    as if the centralized node was the ingress RBridge, instead of being calculated
    using the actual ingress RBridge.  This document updates RFC 6325.
