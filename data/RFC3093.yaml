abstract:
  content: Internet Transparency via the end-to-end architecture of the Internet has
    allowed vast innovation of new technologies and services [1].  However, recent
    developments in Firewall technology have altered this model and have been shown
    to inhibit innovation.  We propose the Firewall Enhancement Protocol (FEP) to
    allow innovation, without violating the security model of a Firewall.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
