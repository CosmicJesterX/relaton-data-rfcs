abstract:
  content: This document provides a pseudo Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) to protect
    multiple source flows with one or more repair flows based on the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) Framework and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) elements
    defined for the framework.  The purpose of the document is not to provide a full-fledged
    protocol but to show how the defined framework and SDP elements can be combined
    together to implement a CDP.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.
