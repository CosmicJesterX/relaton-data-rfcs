  content: 'The rest of this document contains a brief recollection from the present
    RFC Editor Joyce K.  Reynolds, followed by recollections from three pioneers:
    Steve Crocker who wrote RFC 1, Vint Cerf whose long-range vision continues to
    guide us, and Jake Feinler who played a key role in the middle years of the RFC
    series.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.'
