abstract:
  content: This document describes an experimental use case that employs autonomic
    networking for the monitoring of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The use case
    is for detecting violations of SLAs in a distributed fashion. It strives to optimize
    and dynamically adapt the autonomic deployment of active measurement probes in
    a way that maximizes the likelihood of detecting service-level violations with
    a given resource budget to perform active measurements. This optimization and
    adaptation should be done without any outside guidance or intervention. This document
    is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG). It is published
    for informational purposes.
