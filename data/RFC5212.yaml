abstract:
  content: Most of the initial efforts to utilize Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been
    related to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability. The
    complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in
    classical IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies,
    GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi-layered network
    of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies. In
    GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple
    switching types is referred to in this document as a multi-region network (MRN).
    When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either single
    or multiple regions, this document uses the term multi-layer network (MLN). This
    document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region / multi-layer networks
    and lists a set of functional requirements. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.
