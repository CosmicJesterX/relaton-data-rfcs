abstract:
  content: Procedures and protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate measurement
    of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks are defined in RFC 6374.
    The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable
    to the construction and operation of packet- switched transport networks. This
    document describes a profile of the general MPLS loss, delay, and throughput measurement
    techniques that suffices to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-TP. This document
    is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation
    Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
