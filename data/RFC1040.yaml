abstract:
  content: This RFC is the Outgrowth of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings
    and of internal working papers distributed for those meetings.  This memo defines
    message encipherment and authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an
    effort to provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail transfer in
    the Internet.  Detailed key management mechanisms to support these procedures
    will be defined in a subsequent RFC.  As a goal of this initial phase, it is intended
    that the procedures defined here be compatible with a wide range of key management
    approaches, including both conventional (symmetric) and public-key (asymmetric)
    approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.  Use of conventional cryptography
    for message text encryption and/or integrity check computation is anticipated.
