abstract:
  content: This document summarizes an operator's perception of the benefits that
    may be provided by intermediary devices that execute functions beyond normal IP
    forwarding. Such intermediary devices are often called "middleboxes". RFC 3234
    defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the Internet. Most of those middleboxes
    utilize or modify application- layer data. This document primarily focuses on
    devices that observe and act on information carried in the transport layer, and
    especially information carried in TCP packets.
