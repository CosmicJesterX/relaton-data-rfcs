abstract:
- content: This document describes an extension to BGP which may be used to create
    a confederation of autonomous systems that is represented as a single autonomous
    system to BGP peers external to the confederation, thereby removing the "full
    mesh" requirement.  The intention of this extension is to aid in policy administration
    and reduce the management complexity of maintaining a large autonomous system.
