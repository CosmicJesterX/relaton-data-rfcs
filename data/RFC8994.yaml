abstract:
  content: Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends
    on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be
    self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration.  This document
    defines such a plane and calls it the "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary
    use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a "virtual
    out-of-band channel" for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications
    over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated
    and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network
    is not configured or is misconfigured.
