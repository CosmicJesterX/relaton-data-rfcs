abstract:
  content: The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited support
    for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  The current version
    only includes support for three Elliptic Curve groups, and there is a fixed hash
    algorithm tied to each group.  This document generalizes IKEv2 signature support
    to allow any signature method supported by PKIX and also adds signature hash algorithm
    negotiation.  This is a generic mechanism and is not limited to ECDSA; it can
    also be used with other signature algorithms.
