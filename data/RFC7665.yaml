abstract:
  content: This document describes an architecture for the specification, creation,
    and ongoing maintenance of Service Function Chains (SFCs) in a network.  It includes
    architectural concepts, principles, and components used in the construction of
    composite services through deployment of SFCs, with a focus on those to be standardized
    in the IETF.  This document does not propose solutions, protocols, or extensions
    to existing protocols.
