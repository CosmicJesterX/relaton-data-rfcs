abstract:
  content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,
    it describes a set of managed objects that allow configuring middleboxes, such
    as firewalls and network address translators, in order to enable communication
    across these devices.  The definitions of managed objects in this documents follow
    closely the MIDCOM semantics defined in RFC 5189. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
