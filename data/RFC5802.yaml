abstract:
- content: The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by Internet
    application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over a channel
    protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant security
    concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of a challenge
    response authentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately, the challenge
    response mechanisms presently on the standards track all fail to meet requirements
    necessary for widespread deployment, and have had success only in limited use.
    This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication and Security Layer
    (SASL; RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response
    Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns and meets
    the deployability requirements. When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent
    security layer, a mechanism from this family could improve the status quo for
    application protocol authentication and provide a suitable choice for a mandatory-to-implement
    mechanism for future application protocol standards. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
