abstract:
- content: RFC 3175 defines aggregate Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) reservations
    allowing resources to be reserved in a Diffserv network for a given Per Hop Behavior
    (PHB), or given set of PHBs, from a given source to a given destination.  RFC
    3175 also defines how end-to-end RSVP reservations can be aggregated onto such
    aggregate reservations when transiting through a Diffserv cloud.  There are situations
    where multiple such aggregate reservations are needed for the same source IP address,
    destination IP address, and PHB (or set of PHBs).  However, this is not supported
    by the aggregate reservations defined in RFC 3175.  In order to support this,
    the present document defines a more flexible type of aggregate RSVP reservations,
    referred to as generic aggregate reservation.  Multiple such generic aggregate
    reservations can be established for a given PHB (or set of PHBs) from a given
    source IP address to a given destination IP address.  The generic aggregate reservations
    may be used to aggregate end-to-end RSVP reservations.  This document also defines
    the procedures for such aggregation.  The generic aggregate reservations may also
    be used end-to-end directly by end-systems attached to a Diffserv network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
