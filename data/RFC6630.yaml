abstract:
  content: The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework supporting
    multiple types of authentication methods. The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)
    specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent
    protocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer and an EAP re-authentication
    server through any authenticator. Authenticated Anticipatory Keying (AAK) is a
    method by which cryptographic keying material may be established upon one or more
    Candidate Attachment Points (CAPs) prior to handover. AAK uses the AAA infrastructure
    for key transport. This document specifies the extensions necessary to enable
    AAK support in ERP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
