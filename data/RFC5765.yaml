abstract:
  content: Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become popular for certain applications
    and deployments for a variety of reasons, including fault tolerance, economics,
    and legal issues.  It has therefore become reasonable for resource consuming and
    typically centralized applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) and, in general,
    realtime communication to adapt and exploit the benefits of P2P.  Such a migration
    needs to address a new set of P2P-specific security problems.  This document describes
    some of the known issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing the relevance
    of such issues and the applicability of existing solutions when using P2P architectures
    for realtime communication.  This document is a product of the P2P Research Group.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
