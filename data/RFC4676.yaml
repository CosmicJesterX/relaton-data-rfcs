abstract:
  content: This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4 and
    DHCPv6) option containing the civic location of the client or the DHCP server.  The
    Location Configuration Information (LCI) includes information about the country,
    administrative units such as states, provinces, and cities, as well as street
    addresses, postal community names, and building information.  The option allows
    multiple renditions of the same address in different scripts and languages. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
