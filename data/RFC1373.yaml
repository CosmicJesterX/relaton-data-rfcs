abstract:
  content: This document comes in two parts.  The first part is for regular people
    who wish to set up their own DUAs (Directory User Interfaces) to access the Directory.  The
    second part is for ISODE-maintainers wishing to provide portable DUAs to users.  This
    part gives instructions in a similar but longer, step-by-step format.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet
    standard.
