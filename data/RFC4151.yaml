abstract:
  content: This document describes the "tag" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme.  Tag
    URIs (also known as "tags") are designed to be unique across space and time while
    being tractable to humans.  They are distinct from most other URIs in that they
    have no authoritative resolution mechanism.  A tag may be used purely as an entity
    identifier.  Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over the common practice
    of using "http" URIs as identifiers for non-HTTP-accessible resources.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
