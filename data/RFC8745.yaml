abstract:
  content: An active stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) is capable of computing
    as well as controlling via Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs).  Furthermore, it is also possible for an active stateful PCE to create,
    maintain, and delete LSPs.  This document defines the PCEP extension to associate
    two or more LSPs to provide end-to-end path protection.
