abstract:
- content: Despite growing adoption of TLS, a significant fraction of TCP traffic
    on the Internet remains unencrypted.  The persistence of unencrypted traffic can
    be attributed to at least two factors.  First, some legacy protocols lack a signaling
    mechanism (such as a STARTTLS command) by which to convey support for encryption,
    thus making incremental deployment impossible.  Second, legacy applications themselves
    cannot always be upgraded and therefore require a way to implement encryption
    transparently entirely within the transport layer.  The TCP Encryption Negotiation
    Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these problems through a new TCP option kind
    providing out-of-band, fully backward-compatible negotiation of encryption.
