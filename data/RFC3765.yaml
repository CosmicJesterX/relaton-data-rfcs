abstract:
  content: This document describes the use of a scope control Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) community.  This well-known advisory transitive community allows an origin
    AS to specify the extent to which a specific route should be externally propagated.  In
    particular this community, NOPEER, allows an origin AS to specify that a route
    with this attribute need not be advertised across bilateral peer connections.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
