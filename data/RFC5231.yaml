abstract:
  content: This document describes the RELATIONAL extension to the Sieve mail filtering
    language defined in RFC 3028. This extension extends existing conditional tests
    in Sieve to allow relational operators. In addition to testing their content,
    it also allows for testing of the number of entities in header and envelope fields.
    This document obsoletes RFC 3431. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
