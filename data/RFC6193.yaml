abstract:
- content: This document specifies how to establish a media session that represents
    a virtual private network using the Session Initiation Protocol for the purpose
    of on-demand media/application sharing between peers.  It extends the protocol
    identifier of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) so that it can negotiate
    use of the Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) for media sessions in the SDP
    offer/answer model.  It also specifies a method to boot up IKE and generate IPsec
    security associations using a self-signed certificate.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
