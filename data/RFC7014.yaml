abstract:
- content: The Intermediate Flow Selection Process is the process of selecting a subset
    of Flows from all observed Flows.  The Intermediate Flow Selection Process may
    be located at an IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Exporter or Collector, or
    within an IPFIX Mediator.  It reduces the effort of post-processing Flow data
    and transferring Flow Records.  This document describes motivations for using
    the Intermediate Flow Selection process and presents Intermediate Flow Selection
    techniques.  It provides an information model for configuring Intermediate Flow
    Selection Process techniques and discusses what information about an Intermediate
    Flow Selection Process should be exported.
