abstract:
  content: This memo specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the OSI Intra-Domain
    IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway protocol (IGP)
    to support TCP/IP as well as OSI.  This allows a single routing protocol to be
    used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.  This
    specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the Internet Engineering
    Task Force. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
