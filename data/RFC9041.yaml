abstract:
- content: This document updates RFCs 8029 and 8611, both of which define IANA registries
    for MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping. In particular, the registration procedure
    "Private Use" (previously known as "Vendor Private Use") has been changed to "First
    Come First Served" for the TLV and sub-TLV registries. It also updates the description
    of the procedures for the responses sent when an unknown or erroneous code point
    is found. The updates are to clarify and align this namespace with recent developments,
    e.g., aligning terminology with RFC 8126 instead of the now obsoleted RFC 5226
    (both titled "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs").
