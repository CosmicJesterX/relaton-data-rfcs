abstract:
  content: This memo documents a sampling of use cases for securely aggregating configuration
    and operational data and evaluating that data to determine an organization's security
    posture.  From these operational use cases, we can derive common functional capabilities
    and requirements to guide development of vendor-neutral, interoperable standards
    for aggregating and evaluating data relevant to security posture.
