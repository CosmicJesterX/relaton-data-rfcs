abstract:
  content: This memo makes the case for interdependent TCP control blocks, where part
    of the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent connections, or across similar
    connection instances.  TCP state includes a combination of parameters, such as
    connection state, current round-trip time estimates, congestion control information,
    and process information.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This
    memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
