abstract:
  content: This document specifies the conventions for using Message Authentication
    Code (MAC) encryption with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) authenticated-enveloped-data
    content type.  This mirrors the use of a MAC combined with an encryption algorithm
    that's already employed in IPsec, Secure Socket Layer / Transport Layer Security
    (SSL/TLS) and Secure SHell (SSH), which is widely supported in existing crypto
    libraries and hardware and has been extensively analysed by the crypto community.
