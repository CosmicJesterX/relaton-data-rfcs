abstract:
  content: This document defines a new connectivity precondition for the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) precondition framework.  A connectivity precondition can be used
    to delay session establishment or modification until media stream connectivity
    has been successfully verified.  The method of verification may vary depending
    on the type of transport used for the media.  For unreliable datagram transports
    such as UDP, verification involves probing the stream with data or control packets.  For
    reliable connection-oriented transports such as TCP, verification can be achieved
    simply by successful connection establishment or by probing the connection with
    data or control packets, depending on the situation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
