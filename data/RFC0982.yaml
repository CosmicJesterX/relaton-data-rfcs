abstract:
  content: This RFC is a draft working document of the ANSI "Guidelines for the Specification
    of the Structure of the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of the ISO Standard NSAP Address".  It
    provides guidance to private address administration authorities on preferred formats
    and semantics for the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of an NSAP address.  This RFC
    specifies the way in which the DSP may be constructed so as to facilitate efficient
    address assignment.  This RFC is for informational purposes only and its distribution
    is unlimited and does not specify a standard of the ARPA-Internet.
