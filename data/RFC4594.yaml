abstract:
- content: This document describes service classes configured with Diffserv and recommends
    how they can be used and how to construct them using Differentiated Services Code
    Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active Queue
    Management (AQM) mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement that particular
    DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class,
    but as a policy and for interoperability it is useful to apply them consistently.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
