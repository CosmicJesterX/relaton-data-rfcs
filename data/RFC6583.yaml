abstract:
  content: In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover the
    actual number of machines on the subnet. In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet
    size is a /64, a number so large it covers trillions of addresses, the overwhelming
    number of which will be unassigned. Consequently, simplistic implementations of
    Neighbor Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial of
    service (DoS), whereby they attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers
    of unassigned addresses. Such denial-of-service attacks can be launched intentionally
    (by an attacker) or result from legitimate operational tools or accident conditions.
    As a result of these vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to "join" a
    network, it may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6 transported
    flows may be interrupted. This document describes the potential for DoS in detail
    and suggests possible implementation improvements as well as operational mitigation
    techniques that can, in some cases, be used to protect against or at least alleviate
    the impact of such attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
