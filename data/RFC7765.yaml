abstract:
  content: This document describes a modified sender-side algorithm for managing the
    TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) retransmission timers that
    provides faster loss recovery when there is a small amount of outstanding data
    for a connection.  The modification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport
    to restart its retransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that
    the effective retransmission timeout (RTO) becomes more aggressive in situations
    where fast retransmit cannot be used.  This enables faster loss detection and
    recovery for connections that are short lived or application limited.
