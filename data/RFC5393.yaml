abstract:
  content: This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP), to address a security vulnerability identified in SIP proxy behavior. This
    vulnerability enables an attack against SIP networks where a small number of legitimate,
    even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate massive amounts of proxy-to-proxy
    traffic. This document strengthens loop-detection requirements on SIP proxies
    when they fork requests (that is, forward a request to more than one destination).
    It also corrects and clarifies the description of the loop-detection algorithm
    such proxies are required to implement. Additionally, this document defines a
    Max-Breadth mechanism for limiting the number of concurrent branches pursued for
    any given request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
