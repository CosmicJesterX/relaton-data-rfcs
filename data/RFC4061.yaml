abstract:
- content: 'This document provides suggestions for measuring OSPF single router control
    plane convergence. Its initial emphasis is on the control plane of a single OSPF
    router. We do not address forwarding plane performance. NOTE: In this document,
    the word "convergence" relates to single router control plane convergence only.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.'
