abstract:
  content: This document describes the RTP payload format for the BroadVoice(R) narrowband
    and wideband speech codecs.  The narrowband codec, called BroadVoice16, or BV16,
    has been selected by CableLabs as a mandatory codec in PacketCable 1.5 and has
    a CableLabs specification.  The document also provides specifications for the
    use of BroadVoice with MIME and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
