abstract:
- content: This document describes a transport independent protocol for the management
    of trust anchors (TAs) and community identifiers stored in a trust anchor store.  The
    protocol makes use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital signature
    is used to provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.  The protocol
    can be used to manage trust anchor stores containing trust anchors represented
    as Certificate, TBSCertificate, or TrustAnchorInfo objects. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
