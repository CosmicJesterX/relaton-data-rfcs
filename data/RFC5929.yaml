abstract:
  content: This document defines three channel binding types for Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), tls-unique, tls-server-end-point, and tls-unique-for-telnet, in accordance
    with RFC 5056 (On Channel Binding). Note that based on implementation experience,
    this document changes the original definition of 'tls-unique' channel binding
    type in the channel binding type IANA registry. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
