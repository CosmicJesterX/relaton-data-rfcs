abstract:
- content: Over the last two decades, many efforts have been devoted to developing
    solutions for mobility support over the global Internet, resulting in a variety
    of proposed solutions.  We conducted a systematic survey of the previous efforts
    to gain an overall understanding on the solution space of mobility support.  This
    document reports our findings and identifies remaining issues in providing ubiquitous
    and efficient Internet mobility support on a global scale.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
