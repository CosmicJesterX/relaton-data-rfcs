abstract:
- content: The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms
    for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response
    to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests. The extensions for stateful PCE provide
    active control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs) via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control
    over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE. This document describes the
    creation and deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.
