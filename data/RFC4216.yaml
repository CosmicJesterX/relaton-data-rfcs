abstract:
- content: This document discusses requirements for the support of inter-AS MPLS Traffic
    Engineering (MPLS TE).  Its main objective is to present a set of requirements
    and scenarios which would result in general guidelines for the definition, selection,
    and specification development for any technical solution(s) meeting these requirements
    and supporting the scenarios.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
