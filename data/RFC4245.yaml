abstract:
  content: This document examines a wide range of conferencing requirements for tightly
    coupled SIP conferences.  Separate documents will map the requirements to existing
    protocol primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce new protocols
    as needed.  Together, these documents will provide a guide for building interoperable
    SIP conferencing applications.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
