abstract:
  content: The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) includes audit commands
    that only allow a Call Agent to audit endpoint and/or connection state one endpoint
    at a time.  This document describes a new MGCP package for bulk auditing of a
    group of gateway endpoints.  It allows a Call Agent to determine the endpoint
    naming convention, the list of instantiated endpoints as well connection and endpoint
    state for the group of endpoints.
