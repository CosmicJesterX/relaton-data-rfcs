abstract:
- content: The existing IETF standards specify that IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and
    Address Autoconfiguration mechanisms may be protected with IPsec Authentication
    Header (AH).  However, the current specifications limit the security solutions
    to manual keying due to practical problems faced with automatic key management.  This
    document specifies three different trust models and discusses the threats pertinent
    to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  The purpose of this discussion is to define the requirements
    for Securing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
