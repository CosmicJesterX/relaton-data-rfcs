abstract:
  content: 'This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation about
    the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol.  It explains the motivation for including
    a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose information about congestion to network
    nodes.  Although such information may have a number of uses, this document focuses
    on how the information communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as the basis
    for significantly more efficient and effective traffic management than what exists
    on the Internet today.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.'
