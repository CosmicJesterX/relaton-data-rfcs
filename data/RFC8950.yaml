abstract:
  content: Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable next-hop address
    families is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address
    family only have provisions for advertising a next-hop address that belongs to
    the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow
    the advertising of IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a next-hop address that belongs
    to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions
    to allow the address of the next hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong
    to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the next hop to determine which of the protocols
    the address actually belongs to, and a BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP peers to
    dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with
    an IPv6 next hop. This document obsoletes RFC 5549.
