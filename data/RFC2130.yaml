abstract:
- content: This report details the conclusions of an IAB-sponsored invitational workshop
    held 29 February - 1 March, 1996, to discuss the use of character sets on the
    Internet.  It motivates the need to have character set handling in Internet protocols
    which transmit text, provides a conceptual framework for specifying character
    sets, recommends the use of MIME tagging for transmitted text, recommends a default
    character set *without* stating that there is no need for other character sets,
    and makes a series of recommendations to the IAB, IANA, and the IESG for furthering
    the integration of the character set framework into text transmission protocols.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify
    an Internet standard of any kind.
