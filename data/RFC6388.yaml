abstract:
  content: This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP)
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in MPLS networks.  These extensions are also referred
    to as multipoint LDP.  Multipoint LDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP LSPs without
    interacting with or relying upon any other multicast tree construction protocol.  Protocol
    elements and procedures for this solution are described for building such LSPs
    in a receiver-initiated manner.  There can be various applications for multipoint
    LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS Layer 3 Virtual
    Private Networks (L3VPNs).  Specification of how such applications can use an
    LDP signaled multipoint LSP is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
