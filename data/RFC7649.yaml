abstract:
- content: During IETF meetings, individual volunteers often help sessions run more
    smoothly by relaying information back and forth between the physical meeting room
    and an associated textual chatroom.  Such volunteers are commonly called "Jabber
    scribes".  This document summarizes experience with the Jabber scribe role and
    provides some suggestions for fulfilling the role at IETF meetings.
