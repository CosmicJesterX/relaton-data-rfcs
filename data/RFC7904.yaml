abstract:
  content: This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The
    SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or registrar in a fully distributed
    system and includes a lookup service for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the
    overlay.  It also defines Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that allow
    the registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the overlay.  After
    such initial contact of a Peer, the RELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish
    a direct connection between nodes through which SIP messages are exchanged.
