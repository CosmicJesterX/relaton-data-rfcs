abstract:
- content: The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been cryptographically
    signed using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In order to obtain secure answers
    from the root zone of the DNS using DNSSEC, a client must configure a suitable
    trust anchor. This document describes the format and publication mechanisms IANA
    has used to distribute the DNSSEC trust anchors.
