abstract:
  content: This document provides a collection of matching rules for use with the
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  As these matching rules are simple
    adaptations of matching rules specified for use with the X.500 Directory, most
    are already in wide use. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
