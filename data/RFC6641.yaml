abstract:
  content: The NFS version 4 (NFSv4) protocol provides a mechanism for a collection
    of NFS file servers to collaborate in providing an organization-wide file namespace.  The
    DNS SRV Resource Record (RR) allows a simple way for an organization to publish
    the root of its file system namespace, even to clients that might not be intimately
    associated with such an organization.  The DNS SRV RR can be used to join these
    organization-wide file namespaces together to allow construction of a global,
    uniform NFS file namespace. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
