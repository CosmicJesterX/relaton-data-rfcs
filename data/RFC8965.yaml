abstract:
- content: Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm augmented
    with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation avoidance.  This document describes
    a number of niches where Babel has been found to be useful and that are arguably
    not adequately served by more mature protocols.
