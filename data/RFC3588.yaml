abstract:
  content: The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication, Authorization
    and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network access or IP mobility.  Diameter
    is also intended to work in both local Authentication, Authorization & Accounting
    and roaming situations.  This document specifies the message format, transport,
    error reporting, accounting and security services to be used by all Diameter applications.  The
    Diameter base application needs to be supported by all Diameter implementations.
