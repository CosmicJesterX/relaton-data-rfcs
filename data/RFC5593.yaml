abstract:
- content: The existing IMAP URL specification (RFC 5092) lists several <access> identifiers
    and <access> identifier prefixes that can be used to restrict access to URLAUTH-generated
    URLs. However, these identifiers do not provide facilities for new services such
    as streaming. This document proposes a set of new <access> identifiers as well
    as an IANA mechanism to register new <access> identifiers for future applications.
    This document updates RFC 5092. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
