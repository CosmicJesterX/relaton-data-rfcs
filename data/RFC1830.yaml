abstract:
- content: This memo defines two extensions to the SMTP service.  The first service
    enables a SMTP client and server to negotiate the use of an alternate DATA command
    "BDAT" for efficiently sending large MIME messages.  The second extension takes
    advantage of the BDAT command to permit the negotiated sending of unencoded binary
    data.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
