abstract:
  content: Implementors of systems that use public key cryptography to exchange symmetric
    keys need to make the public keys resistant to some predetermined level of attack.  That
    level of attack resistance is the strength of the system, and the symmetric keys
    that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the system strength requirements.  The
    three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength, and public key strength,
    must be consistently matched for any network protocol usage.  While it is fairly
    easy to express the system strength requirements in terms of a symmetric key length
    and to choose a cipher that has a key length equal to or exceeding that requirement,
    it is harder to choose a public key that has a cryptographic strength meeting
    a symmetric key strength requirement.  This document explains how to determine
    the length of an asymmetric key as a function of a symmetric key strength requirement.  Some
    rules of thumb for estimating equivalent resistance to large-scale attacks on
    various algorithms are given.  The document also addresses how changing the sizes
    of the underlying large integers (moduli, group sizes, exponents, and so on) changes
    the time to use the algorithms for key exchange.  This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.
