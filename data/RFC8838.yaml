abstract:
  content: This document describes "Trickle ICE", an extension to the Interactive
    Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that enables ICE agents to begin connectivity
    checks while they are still gathering candidates, by incrementally exchanging
    candidates over time instead of all at once.  This method can considerably accelerate
    the process of establishing a communication session.
