abstract:
  content: The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and
    other secure network services over an insecure network. The Generic Security Service
    Application Program Interface (GSS-API) provides security services to callers
    in a mechanism-independent fashion. This memo describes methods for using the
    GSS-API for authentication and key exchange in SSH. It defines an SSH user authentication
    method that uses a specified GSS-API mechanism to authenticate a user, and a family
    of SSH key exchange methods that use GSS-API to authenticate a Diffie-Hellman
    key exchange. This memo also defines a new host public key algorithm that can
    be used when no operations are needed using a host's public key, and a new user
    authentication method that allows an authorization name to be used in conjunction
    with any authentication that has already occurred as a side-effect of GSS-API-based
    key exchange. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
