abstract:
  content: The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common
    XML format for document exchange, and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) defines
    extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security incidents
    within consortia of network operators and enterprises.  This document specifies
    a transport protocol for RID based upon the passing of RID messages over HTTP/TLS
    (Transport Layer Security).  This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.
