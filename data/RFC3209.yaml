abstract:
- content: This document describes the use of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol),
    including all the necessary extensions, to establish label-switched paths (LSPs)
    in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching).  Since the flow along an LSP is completely
    identified by the label applied at the ingress node of the path, these paths may
    be treated as tunnels.  A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering
    with MPLS as specified in RFC 2702. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
