abstract:
  content: 'Protection and recovery are important features of service offerings in
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Increasingly,
    MPLS and GMPLS networks are being extended from single domain scope to multi-domain
    environments. Various schemes and processes have been developed to establish Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain environments. These are discussed in RFC
    4726: "A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering".
    This document analyzes the application of these techniques to protection and recovery
    in multi-domain networks. The main focus for this document is on establishing
    end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain networks. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.'
