abstract:
  content: Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are wireless technologies with characteristics
    such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly very small packet and application-layer
    data sizes, and long battery life operation.  This memo is an informational overview
    of the set of LPWAN technologies being considered in the IETF and of the gaps
    that exist between the needs of those technologies and the goal of running IP
    in LPWANs.
