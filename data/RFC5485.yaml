abstract:
  content: This document specifies the conventions for digital signatures on Internet-Drafts.  The
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used to create a detached signature, which
    is stored in a separate companion file so that no existing utilities are impacted
    by the addition of the digital signature.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.
