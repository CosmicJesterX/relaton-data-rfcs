abstract:
  content: This document examines the general framework of Realm Specific IP (RSIP).  RSIP
    is intended as a alternative to NAT in which the end-to- end integrity of packets
    is maintained.  We focus on implementation issues, deployment scenarios, and interaction
    with other layer-three protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
