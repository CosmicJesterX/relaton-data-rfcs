abstract:
- content: This document describes how the "Tao of the IETF", which has been published
    as a series of RFCs in the past, is instead being published as a web page.  It
    also contains the procedure for publishing and editing that web page.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
