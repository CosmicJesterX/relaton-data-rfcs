abstract:
  content: Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing
    in a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections
    of related objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written using
    a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1].  It is the purpose
    of this document, the Structure of Management Information (SMI), to define that
    subset. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
