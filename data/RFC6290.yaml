abstract:
  content: This document describes an extension to the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    version 2 (IKEv2) that allows for faster detection of Security Association (SA)
    desynchronization using a saved token. When an IPsec tunnel between two IKEv2
    peers is disconnected due to a restart of one peer, it can take as much as several
    minutes for the other peer to discover that the reboot has occurred, thus delaying
    recovery. In this text, we propose an extension to the protocol that allows for
    recovery immediately following the restart. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
