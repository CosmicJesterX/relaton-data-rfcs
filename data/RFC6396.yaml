abstract:
  content: This document describes the MRT format for routing information export.  This
    format was developed in concert with the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT)
    from whence the format takes it name.  The format can be used to export routing
    protocol messages, state changes, and routing information base contents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
