abstract:
  content: With the maturity of the Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration
    (EDIINT) standards of AS1, AS2, and AS3, applications and additional features
    are being built upon the basic secure transport functionality.  These features
    are not necessarily supported by all EDIINT applications and could cause potential
    problems with implementations.  The EDIINT-Features header field provides a means
    to resolve these problems and support new functionality.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
