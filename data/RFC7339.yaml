abstract:
  content: Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when SIP
    servers have insufficient resources to handle all the SIP messages they receive.  Even
    though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through
    its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable
    to overload.  This document defines the behavior of SIP servers involved in overload
    control and also specifies a loss-based overload scheme for SIP.
