abstract:
  content: This document updates RFC 5761 by clarifying the SDP offer/answer negotiation
    of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing.  It makes it clear that an
    answerer can only include an "a=rtcp-mux" attribute in a Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) answer if the associated SDP offer contained the attribute.
