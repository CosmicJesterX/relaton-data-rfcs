abstract:
- content: Minor versions of Network File System (NFS) version 4 newer than minor
    version 0 work best when Remote Procedure Call (RPC) transports can send RPC transactions
    in both directions on the same connection.  This document describes how RPC transport
    endpoints capable of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) convey RPCs in both directions
    on a single connection.
