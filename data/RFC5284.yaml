abstract:
- content: The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC object for
    communicating errors. That object has a defined format that permits the definition
    of 256 error codes. As RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has
    been to be conservative in defining new error codes. Further, no provision for
    user-defined errors exists in RSVP. This document defines a USER_ERROR_SPEC to
    be used in addition to the ERROR_SPEC to carry additional user information related
    to errors. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
