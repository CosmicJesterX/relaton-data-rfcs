abstract:
  content: Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path without
    relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or RSVP-TE). It depends
    only on "segments" that are advertised by link-state Interior Gateway Protocols
    (IGPs). An SR path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP
    Shortest Path Tree (SPT), an explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element
    (PCE). This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic-Engineering
    (TE) paths, as well as a Path Computation Client (PCC) to request a path subject
    to certain constraints and optimization criteria in SR networks. This document
    updates RFC 8408.
