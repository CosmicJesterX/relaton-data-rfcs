abstract:
  content: This document describes BagIt, a set of hierarchical file layout conventions
    for storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content.  A "bag" has just enough
    structure to enclose descriptive metadata "tags" and a file "payload" but does
    not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics.  This BagIt format
    is suitable for reliable storage and transfer.
