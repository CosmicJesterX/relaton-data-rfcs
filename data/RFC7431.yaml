abstract:
  content: As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are looking
    for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to faults in the IP network
    carrying the packets for these services.  This document describes a mechanism
    for minimizing packet loss in a network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast-only
    Fast Reroute (MoFRR) works by making simple enhancements to multicast routing
    protocols such as Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Multipoint LDP (mLDP).
