abstract:
  content: This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an
    authentication framework which supports multiple authentication methods.  EAP
    typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol
    (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate
    elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation
    is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support
    this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.  A summary of the changes between this
    document and RFC 2284 is available in Appendix A. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
