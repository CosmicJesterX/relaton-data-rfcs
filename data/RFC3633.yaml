abstract:
  content: The Prefix Delegation options provide a mechanism for automated delegation
    of IPv6 prefixes using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  This mechanism
    is intended for delegating a long-lived prefix from a delegating router to a requesting
    router, across an administrative boundary, where the delegating router does not
    require knowledge about the topology of the links in the network to which the
    prefixes will be assigned.
