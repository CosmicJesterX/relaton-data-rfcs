abstract:
- content: This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4 and
    DHCPv6) options that contain a list of IP addresses and a list of domain names
    that can be mapped to servers providing IEEE 802.21 type of Mobility Service (MoS)
    (see RFC 5677).  These Mobility Services are used to assist a mobile node (MN)
    in handover preparation (network discovery) and handover decision (network selection).  The
    services addressed in this document are the Media Independent Handover Services
    defined in IEEE 802.21. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
