abstract:
- content: The Security Considerations sections of many Internet Drafts say, in effect,
    "just use IPsec".  While this is sometimes correct, more often it will leave users
    without real, interoperable security mechanisms.  This memo offers some guidance
    on when IPsec Version 2 should and should not be specified.  This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.
