abstract:
  content: Most IMAP extensions are used by the client when it wants to and the server
    supports it.  However, a few extensions require the server to know whether a client
    supports that extension.  The ENABLE extension allows an IMAP client to say which
    extensions it supports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
