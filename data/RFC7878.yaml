abstract:
  content: The Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF) specifies the data model
    and the overall structure to provision Session Establishment Data (SED) into Session
    Data Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores.  To utilize this framework,
    one needs a substrate protocol.  Given that the Simple Object Access Protocol
    (SOAP) is currently widely used for messaging between elements of such provisioning
    systems, this document specifies the usage of SOAP (via HTTPS) as the substrate
    protocol for SPPF.  The benefits include leveraging prevalent expertise and a
    higher probability that existing provisioning systems will be able to easily migrate
    to using an \%SPPF- based protocol.
