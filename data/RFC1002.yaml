abstract:
- content: 'This RFC defines a proposed standard protocol to support NetBIOS services
    in a TCP/IP environment.  Both local network and internet operation are supported.  Various
    node types are defined to accommodate local and internet topologies and to allow
    operation with or without the use of IP broadcast.  This RFC gives the detailed
    specifications of the netBIOS-over-TCP packets, protocols, and defined constants
    and variables.  A more general overview is found in a companion RFC, "Protocol
    Standard For NetBIOS Service on TCP/UDP Transport: Concepts and Methods".'
