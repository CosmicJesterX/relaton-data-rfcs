abstract:
  content: This note describes the fundamental algorithms of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    (ECC) as they were defined in some seminal references from 1994 and earlier.  These
    descriptions may be useful for implementing the fundamental algorithms without
    using any of the specialized methods that were developed in following years.  Only
    elliptic curves defined over fields of characteristic greater than three are in
    scope; these curves are those used in Suite B.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
