abstract:
  content: This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)
    defined in RFC 5070 to support the reporting of phishing events, which is a particular
    type of fraud.  These extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned
    from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle -- from receipt of
    the phishing lure to the disablement of the collection site.  Both simple reporting
    and complete forensic reporting are possible, as is consolidating multiple incidents.
