abstract:
  content: This note discusses how to extend the DNS with new data for a new application.  DNS
    extension discussions too often focus on reuse of the TXT Resource Record Type.  This
    document lists different mechanisms to extend the DNS, and concludes that the
    use of a new DNS Resource Record Type is the best solution.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
