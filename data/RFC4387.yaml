abstract:
  content: The protocol conventions described in this document satisfy some of the
    operational requirements of the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  This
    document specifies the conventions for using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
    as an interface mechanism to obtain certificates and certificate revocation lists
    (CRLs) from PKI repositories.  Additional mechanisms addressing PKIX operational
    requirements are specified in separate documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
