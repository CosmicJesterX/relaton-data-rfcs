abstract:
  content: A message originator sometimes sends content in a form the recipient cannot
    process or would prefer not to process a form of lower quality than is preferred.  Such
    content needs to be converted to an acceptable form, with the same information
    or constrained information (e.g., changing from color to black and white).  In
    a store-and-forward environment, it may be convenient to have this conversion
    performed by an intermediary.  This specification integrates two ESMTP extensions
    and three MIME content header fields, which defines a cooperative service that
    permits authorized, accountable content form conversion by intermediaries. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
