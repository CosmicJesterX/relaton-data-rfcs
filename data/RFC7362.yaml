abstract:
  content: This document describes the behavior of signaling intermediaries in Real-Time
    Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border Controllers
    (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT). HNT is a set of mechanisms,
    such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other
    RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other. This document is non-normative
    and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference to the Internet
    community and an informative description to manufacturers and users. Latching,
    which is one of the HNT components, has a number of security issues covered here.
    Because of those, and unless all security considerations explained here are taken
    into account and solved, the IETF advises against use of the latching mechanism
    over the Internet and recommends other solutions, such as the Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) protocol.
