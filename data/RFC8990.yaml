abstract:
- content: This document specifies the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP),
    which enables autonomic nodes and Autonomic Service Agents to dynamically discover
    peers, to synchronize state with each other, and to negotiate parameter settings
    with each other.  GRASP depends on an external security environment that is described
    elsewhere.  The technical objectives and parameters for specific application scenarios
    are to be described in separate documents.  Appendices briefly discuss requirements
    for the protocol and existing protocols with comparable features.
