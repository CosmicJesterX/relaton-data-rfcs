abstract:
- content: The IETF has standardized IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) for measuring end-to-end
    performance between two points.  This memo defines two new categories of metrics
    that extend the coverage to multiple measurement points.  It defines spatial metrics
    for measuring the performance of segments of a source to destination path, and
    metrics for measuring the performance between a source and many destinations in
    multiparty communications (e.g., a multicast tree). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
