abstract:
  content: This document specifies extensions for the HTTP authentication framework
    for interactive clients.  Currently, fundamental features of HTTP-level authentication
    are insufficient for complex requirements of various Web-based applications.  This
    forces these applications to implement their own authentication frameworks by
    means such as HTML forms, which becomes one of the hurdles against introducing
    secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and user agents.  The
    extended framework fills gaps between Web application requirements and HTTP authentication
    provisions to solve the above problems, while maintaining compatibility with existing
    Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentication.
