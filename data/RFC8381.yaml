abstract:
- content: The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    is implemented by devices called TRILL switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).  TRILL
    includes a general mechanism, called an RBridge Channel, for the transmission
    of typed messages between RBridges in the same campus and between RBridges and
    end stations on the same link.  This document specifies a method to send vendor-specific
    messages over the RBridge Channel facility.
