abstract:
- content: This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to reduce periodic
    flooding of Link State Advertisements (LSAs) in stable topologies. Current OSPF
    behavior requires that all LSAs, except DoNotAge LSAs, to be refreshed every 30
    minutes. This document proposes to generalize the use of DoNotAge LSAs in order
    to reduce protocol traffic in stable topologies. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
