abstract:
  content: Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData includes the SignerInfo structure
    to convey per-signer information.  SignedData supports multiple signers and multiple
    signature algorithms per signer with multiple SignerInfo structures.  If a signer
    attaches more than one SignerInfo, there are concerns that an attacker could perform
    a downgrade attack by removing the SignerInfo(s) with the \'strong' algorithm(s).  This
    document defines the multiple-signatures attribute, its generation rules, and
    its processing rules to allow signers to convey multiple SignerInfo objects while
    protecting against downgrade attacks.  Additionally, this attribute may assist
    during periods of algorithm migration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
