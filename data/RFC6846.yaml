abstract:
  content: This document specifies a RObust Header Compression (ROHC) profile for
    compression of TCP/IP packets. The profile, called ROHC-TCP, provides efficient
    and robust compression of TCP headers, including frequently used TCP options such
    as selective acknowledgments (SACKs) and Timestamps. ROHC-TCP works well when
    used over links with significant error rates and long round-trip times. For many
    bandwidth-limited links where header compression is essential, such characteristics
    are common. This specification obsoletes RFC 4996. It fixes a technical issue
    with the SACK compression and clarifies other compression methods used. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
