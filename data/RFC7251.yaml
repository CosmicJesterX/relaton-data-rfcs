abstract:
  content: This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in
    the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data-origin authentication.  The AES-CCM
    algorithm is amenable to compact implementations, making it suitable for constrained
    environments, while at the same time providing a high level of security.  The
    cipher suites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and
    are advantageous in networks with limited bandwidth.
