abstract:
  content: The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an energy management
    framework for networked devices.  This document presents the applicability of
    the EMAN information model in a variety of scenarios with cases and target devices.  These
    use cases are useful for identifying requirements for the framework and MIBs.  Further,
    we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to other relevant energy monitoring
    standards and architectures.
