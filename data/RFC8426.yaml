abstract:
- content: Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing (SR) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks running Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) LSPs.  In some instances, operators are also migrating existing
    services from RSVP-TE to SR LSPs.  For example, there might be certain services
    that are well suited for SR and need to coexist with RSVP-TE in the same network.  Such
    introduction or migration of traffic to SR might require coexistence with RSVP-TE
    in the same network for an extended period of time, depending on the operator's
    intent.  The following document provides solution options for keeping the traffic
    engineering database consistent across the network, accounting for the different
    bandwidth utilization between SR and RSVP-TE.
