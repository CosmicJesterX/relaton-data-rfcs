abstract:
- content: This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as input
    to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting up point-to-multipoint
    (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP), in order to deliver point-to-multipoint applications
    over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure. This work was overtaken
    by the protocol solution developed by the MPLS working group, but that solution
    did not closely follow the requirements documented here. This document is published
    as a historic record of the ideas and requirements that shaped the protocol work.
    This document defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.
