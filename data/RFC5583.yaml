abstract:
  content: This memo defines semantics that allow for signaling the decoding dependency
    of different media descriptions with the same media type in the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP). This is required, for example, if media data is separated and
    transported in different network streams as a result of the use of a layered or
    multiple descriptive media coding process. A new grouping type "DDP" -- decoding
    dependency -- is defined, to be used in conjunction with RFC 3388 entitled "Grouping
    of Media Lines in the Session Description Protocol". In addition, an attribute
    is specified describing the relationship of the media streams in a "DDP" group
    indicated by media identification attribute(s) and media format description(s).
