abstract:
  content: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER method provides a mechanism
    where one party (the referrer) gives a second party (the referee) an arbitrary
    URI to reference.  If that URI is a SIP URI, the referee will send a SIP request,
    often an INVITE, to that URI (the refer target).  This document extends the REFER
    method, allowing the referrer to provide information about the REFER request to
    the refer target using the referee as an intermediary.  This information includes
    the identity of the referrer and the URI to which the referrer referred.  The
    mechanism utilizes S/MIME to help protect this information from a malicious intermediary.  This
    protection is optional, but a recipient may refuse to accept a request unless
    it is present. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
