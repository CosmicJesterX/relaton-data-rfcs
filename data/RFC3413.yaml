abstract:
  content: This document describes five types of Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP) applications which make use of an SNMP engine as described in STD 62, RFC
    3411.  The types of application described are Command Generators, Command Responders,
    Notification Originators, Notification Receivers, and Proxy Forwarders.  This
    document also defines Management Information Base (MIB) modules for specifying
    targets of management operations, for notification filtering, and for proxy forwarding.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 2573. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
