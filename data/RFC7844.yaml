abstract:
  content: Some DHCP options carry unique identifiers.  These identifiers can enable
    device tracking even if the device administrator takes care of randomizing other
    potential identifications like link-layer addresses or IPv6 addresses.  The anonymity
    profiles are designed for clients that wish to remain anonymous to the visited
    network.  The profiles provide guidelines on the composition of DHCP or DHCPv6
    messages, designed to minimize disclosure of identifying information.
