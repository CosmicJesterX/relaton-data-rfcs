abstract:
  content: This memo updates the ODETTE File Transfer Protocol, an established file
    transfer protocol facilitating electronic data interchange of business data between
    trading partners, to version 2. The protocol now supports secure and authenticated
    communication over the Internet using Transport Layer Security, provides file
    encryption, signing, and compression using Cryptographic Message Syntax, and provides
    signed receipts for the acknowledgement of received files. The protocol supports
    both direct peer-to-peer communication and indirect communication via a Value
    Added Network and may be used with TCP/IP, X.25, and ISDN-based networks. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
