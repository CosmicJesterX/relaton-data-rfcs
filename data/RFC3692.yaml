abstract:
  content: When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary to
    use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test or experiment
    with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment.  For example,
    to test a new DHCP option, one needs an option number to identify the new function.  This
    document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations sections, authors should
    consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation purposes that
    implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other new features.  This
    document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific
    protocols where the need to support experimentation has been identified.
