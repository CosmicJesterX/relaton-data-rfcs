abstract:
  content: In the early days of the Arpanet, each specification contained its own
    definition of ABNF.  This included the email specifications, RFC733 and then RFC822
    which have come to be the common citations for defining ABNF.  The current document
    separates out that definition, to permit selective reference.  Predictably, it
    also provides some modifications and enhancements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
