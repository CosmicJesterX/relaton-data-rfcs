abstract:
  content: Nimrod is a scalable routing architecture designed to accommodate a continually
    expanding and diversifying internetwork.  First suggested by Noel Chiappa, the
    Nimrod architecture has undergone revision and refinement through the efforts
    of the Nimrod working group of the IETF.  In this document, we present a detailed
    description of this architecture.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
