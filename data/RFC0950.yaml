abstract:
  content: This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which
    are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For administrative
    or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network
    into several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.  This
    memo specifies procedures for the use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts
    (e.g., workstations).  The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are
    not fully described.  Important motivation and background information for a subnetting
    standard is provided in RFC-940.  This RFC specifies a protocol for the ARPA-Internet
    community.  If subnetting is implemented it is strongly recommended that these
    procedures be followed.
