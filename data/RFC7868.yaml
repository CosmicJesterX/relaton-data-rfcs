abstract:
  content: This document describes the protocol design and architecture for Enhanced
    Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).  EIGRP is a routing protocol based
    on Distance Vector technology.  The specific algorithm used is called "DUAL",
    a Diffusing Update Algorithm as referenced in "Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing
    Computations" (Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993).  The algorithm and procedures were researched,
    developed, and simulated by SRI International.
