abstract:
- content: 'The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport protocol
    used to establish associations between two endpoints. RFC 8261 specifies how SCTP
    can be used on top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, which
    is referred to as SCTP-over-DTLS. This specification defines the following new
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) protocol identifiers (proto values): "UDP/DTLS/SCTP"
    and "TCP/DTLS/SCTP". This specification also specifies how to use the new proto
    values with the SDP offer/answer mechanism for negotiating SCTP-over-DTLS associations.'
