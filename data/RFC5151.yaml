abstract:
  content: This document describes procedures and protocol extensions for the use
    of Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in Multiprotocol
    Label Switching-Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) packet networks and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) packet and non-packet networks to support the establishment and maintenance
    of Label Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries. For the purpose of this
    document, a domain is considered to be any collection of network elements within
    a common realm of address space or path computation responsibility. Examples of
    such domains include Autonomous Systems, Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing
    areas, and GMPLS overlay networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
