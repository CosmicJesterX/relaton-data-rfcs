abstract:
- content: The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose
    design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small
    message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These
    design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1
    and MessagePack. This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements,
    new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange
    format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format.
