abstract:
- content: This memo records experiences in implementing and using the Traffic Flow
    Measurement Architecture and Meter MIB.  It discusses the implementation of NeTraMet
    (a traffic meter) and NeMaC (a combined manager and meter reader), considers the
    writing of meter rule sets and gives some guidance on setting up a traffic flow
    measurement system using NeTraMet.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
