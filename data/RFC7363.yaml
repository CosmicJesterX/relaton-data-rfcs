abstract:
- content: REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling
    protocol that provides an overlay network service.  Peers in a RELOAD overlay
    network collectively run an overlay algorithm to organize the overlay and to store
    and retrieve data.  This document describes how the default topology plugin of
    RELOAD can be extended to support self-tuning, that is, to adapt to changing operating
    conditions such as churn and network size.
