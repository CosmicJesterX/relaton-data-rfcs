abstract:
  content: As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, the syntax and
    semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) have changed.  Many deployed nameservers
    understand variants of these semantics.  Dangerous interactions can occur when
    a resolver that understands an earlier version of these semantics queries an authoritative
    server that understands the new delegation signer semantics, including at least
    one failure scenario that will cause an unsecured zone to be unresolvable.  This
    document changes the type codes and mnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and
    NXT) to avoid those interactions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
