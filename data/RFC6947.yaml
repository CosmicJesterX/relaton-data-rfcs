abstract:
- content: This document proposes a mechanism that allows the same SDP offer to carry
    multiple IP addresses of different address families (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6). The
    proposed attribute, the "altc" attribute, solves the backward-compatibility problem
    that plagued Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) due to their syntax. The
    proposed solution is applicable to scenarios where connectivity checks are not
    required. If connectivity checks are required, Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE), as specified in RFC 5245, provides such a solution.
