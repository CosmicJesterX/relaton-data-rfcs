abstract:
- content: 'The TCP/IP protocol family runs over a variety of network media: IEEE
    802.3 (ethernet) and 802.5 (token ring) LAN''s, X.25 lines, satellite links, and
    serial lines.  There are standard encapsulations for IP packets defined for many
    of these networks, but there is no standard for serial lines.  SLIP, Serial Line
    IP, is a currently a de facto standard, commonly used for point-to-point serial
    connections running TCP/IP.  It is not an Internet standard.'
