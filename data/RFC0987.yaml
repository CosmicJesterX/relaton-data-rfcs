abstract:
- content: The X.400 series protocols have been defined by CCITT to provide an Interpersonal
    Messaging Service (IPMS), making use of a store and forward Message Transfer Service.  It
    is expected that this standard will be implemented very widely.  This document
    describes a set of mappings which will enable interworking between systems operating
    the X.400 protocols and systems using RFC-822 mail protocol or protocols derived
    from RFC-822.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
