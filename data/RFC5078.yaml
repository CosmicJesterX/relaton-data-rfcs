abstract:
- content: RFC 3777 defines the Nominations and Recall Committee's (NomCom's) operation,
    and includes a sample timeline for major steps in the NomCom process that meets
    the minimum normative requirements for the process.  Recent NomComs have been
    scheduling based on the sample timeline, and the chairs of the last three NomComs
    -- Danny McPherson (2004-2005), Ralph Droms (2005-2006), and Andrew Lange (2006-2007)
    -- have all reported that this timeline is very aggressive and suggested starting
    earlier.  This document restructures the sample timeline, but makes no normative
    process changes.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
