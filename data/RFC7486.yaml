abstract:
  content: HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a digital-signature-based design
    for an HTTP authentication method.  The design can also be used in JavaScript-based
    authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication
    schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords,
    such as leakage of server-side password databases.
