abstract:
  content: Measuring capacity is a task that sounds simple, but in reality can be
    quite complex.  In addition, the lack of a unified nomenclature on this subject
    makes it increasingly difficult to properly build, test, and use techniques and
    tools built around these constructs.  This document provides definitions for the
    terms 'Capacity' and 'Available Capacity' related to IP traffic traveling between
    a source and destination in an IP network.  By doing so, we hope to provide a
    common framework for the discussion and analysis of a diverse set of current and
    future estimation techniques.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
