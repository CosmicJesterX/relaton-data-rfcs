abstract:
  content: 'The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) aims to improve the Internet
    routing scalability properties by leveraging three principles: address role separation,
    encapsulation, and mapping.  In this document, based on implementation work, deployment
    experiences, and theoretical studies, we discuss the impact that the deployment
    of LISP can have on both the routing infrastructure and the end user.'
