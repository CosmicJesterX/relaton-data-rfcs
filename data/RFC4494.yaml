abstract:
  content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently
    specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), which is equivalent
    to the One-Key CBC-MAC1 (OMAC1) algorithm submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.  OMAC1
    efficiently reduces the key size of Extended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC).  This
    memo specifies the use of CMAC mode as an authentication mechanism of the IPsec
    Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) protocols.  This
    new algorithm is named AES-CMAC-96. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
