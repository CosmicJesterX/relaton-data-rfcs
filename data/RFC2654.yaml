abstract:
- content: This document defines a mechanism by which information servers can exchange
    indices of information from their databases by making use of the Common Indexing
    Protocol (CIP).  This document defines the structure of the index information
    being exchanged, as well as the appropriate meanings for the headers that are
    defined in the Common Indexing Protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
