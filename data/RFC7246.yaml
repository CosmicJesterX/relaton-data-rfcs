abstract:
  content: An IP Multicast Distribution Tree (MDT) may traverse both label switching
    (i.e., Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS) and non-label switching regions
    of a network.  Typically, the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels
    through an MPLS region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the
    MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path
    (MP-LSP) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then convert it back to a
    pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.  Other documents specify
    the procedures for building such a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast
    (PIM) in the non-MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Label Distribution
    Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends those procedures to
    handle the case where the link connecting the two regions is a Virtual Routing
    and Forwarding (VRF) table link, as defined in the "BGP IP/MPLS VPN" specification.  However,
    this document is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs are used to
    support multicast applications other than multicast VPN.
