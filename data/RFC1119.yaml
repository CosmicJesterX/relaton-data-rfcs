abstract:
  content: This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), specifies its
    formal structure and summarizes information useful for its implementation.  NTP
    provides the mechanisms to synchronize time and coordinate time distribution in
    a large, diverse internet operating at rates from mundane to lightwave.  It uses
    a returnable-time design in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating
    in a self- organizing, hierarchical-master-slave configuration synchronizes local
    clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or radio.  The
    servers can also redistribute reference time via local routing algorithms and
    time daemons. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
