abstract:
  content: There is some known misbehavior of DNS authoritative servers when they
    are queried for AAAA resource records.  Such behavior can block IPv4 communication
    that should actually be available, cause a significant delay in name resolution,
    or even make a denial of service attack.  This memo describes details of known
    cases and discusses their effects.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
