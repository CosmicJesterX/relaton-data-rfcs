abstract:
  content: This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can be employed
    in Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) networks in order to decrease
    the data loss associated with deterministic blackholing of packets during transient
    network conditions.  The mechanism proposed here requires no IS-IS protocol changes
    and is completely interoperable with the existing IS-IS specification.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
