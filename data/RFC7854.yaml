abstract:
  content: This document defines the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), which can be used
    to monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface for
    obtaining route views.  Prior to the introduction of BMP, screen scraping was
    the most commonly used approach to obtaining such views.  The design goals are
    to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service affecting.  BMP
    is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.
