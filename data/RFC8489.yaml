abstract:
- content: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as
    a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal. It can be used by an
    endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT. It can
    also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol
    to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs and does not require
    any special behavior from them. STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.
    Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution. This
    document obsoletes RFC 5389.
