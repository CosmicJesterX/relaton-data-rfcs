abstract:
- content: The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning of transport
    paths via a Network Management System (NMS) and dynamic provisioning of transport
    paths via a control plane. This document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic
    provisioning and covers control-plane addressing, routing, path computation, signaling,
    traffic engineering, and path recovery. MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the control plane
    for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs). MPLS-TP also uses the pseudowire (PW)
    control plane for pseudowires. Management-plane functions are out of scope of
    this document. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
    Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
