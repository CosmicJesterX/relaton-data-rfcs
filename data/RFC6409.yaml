abstract:
  content: This memo splits message submission from message relay, allowing each service
    to operate according to its own rules (for security, policy, etc.), and specifies
    what actions are to be taken by a submission server. Message relay is unaffected,
    and continues to use SMTP over port 25. When conforming to this document, message
    submission uses the protocol specified here, normally over port 587. This separation
    of function offers a number of benefits, including the ability to apply specific
    security or policy requirements. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
