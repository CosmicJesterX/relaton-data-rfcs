abstract:
- content: The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web.  It
    facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing
    datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime negotiation is a variation on content
    negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred
    datetime.  TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate
    prior states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates recognizing
    a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.
