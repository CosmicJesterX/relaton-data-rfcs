abstract:
- content: To date, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has used a Simple
    Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) profile which always required at least
    one complete round trip for an authentication, as it did not support an initial
    client response argument. This additional round trip at the beginning of the session
    is undesirable, especially when round-trip costs are high. This document defines
    an extension to IMAP which allows clients and servers to avoid this round trip
    by allowing an initial client response argument to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command.
