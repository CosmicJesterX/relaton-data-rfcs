abstract:
  content: This document explains what is meant by the term "network transport Circuit
    Breaker".  It describes the need for Circuit Breakers (CBs) for network tunnels
    and applications when using non-congestion- controlled traffic and explains where
    CBs are, and are not, needed.  It also defines requirements for building a CB
    and the expected outcomes of using a CB within the Internet.
