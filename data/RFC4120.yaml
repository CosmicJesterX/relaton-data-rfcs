abstract:
  content: This document provides an overview and specification of Version 5 of the
    Kerberos protocol, and it obsoletes RFC 1510 to clarify aspects of the protocol
    and its intended use that require more detailed or clearer explanation than was
    provided in RFC 1510.  This document is intended to provide a detailed description
    of the protocol, suitable for implementation, together with descriptions of the
    appropriate use of protocol messages and fields within those messages. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
