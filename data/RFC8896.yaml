abstract:
  content: This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO cost information service so that applications
    decide not only 'where' to connect but also 'when'.  This is useful for applications
    that need to perform bulk data transfer and would like to schedule these transfers
    during an off-peak hour, for example.  This extension introduces the ALTO Cost
    Calendar with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost values in JSON arrays where
    each value corresponds to a given time interval.  The time intervals, as well
    as other Calendar attributes, are specified in the Information Resources Directory
    and ALTO Server responses.
