  content: This document describes how to carry 64 kbit/s channel data transparently
    in RTP packets, using a pseudo-codec called "Clearmode". It also serves as registration
    for a related MIME type called "audio/clearmode". "Clearmode" is a basic feature
    of VoIP Media Gateways. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
