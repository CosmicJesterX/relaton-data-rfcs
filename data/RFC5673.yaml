abstract:
- content: The wide deployment of lower-cost wireless devices will significantly improve
    the productivity and safety of industrial plants while increasing the efficiency
    of plant workers by extending the information set available about the plant operations.  The
    aim of this document is to analyze the functional requirements for a routing protocol
    used in industrial Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) of field devices.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
