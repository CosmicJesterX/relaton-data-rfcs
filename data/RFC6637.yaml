abstract:
- content: This document defines an Elliptic Curve Cryptography extension to the OpenPGP
    public key format and specifies three Elliptic Curves that enjoy broad support
    by other standards, including standards published by the US National Institute
    of Standards and Technology.  The document specifies the conventions for interoperability
    between compliant OpenPGP implementations that make use of this extension and
    these Elliptic Curves. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
