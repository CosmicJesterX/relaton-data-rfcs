abstract:
  content: This document describes the terms to be used in a methodology that determines
    the IP packet forwarding performance of IP routers as a function of the forwarding
    information base installed within a router.  The forwarding performance of an
    IP router may be dependent upon or may be linked to the composition and size of
    the forwarding information base installed within a router.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
