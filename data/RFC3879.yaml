abstract:
  content: This document describes the issues surrounding the use of IPv6 site-local
    unicast addresses in their original form, and formally deprecates them.  This
    deprecation does not prevent their continued use until a replacement has been
    standardized and implemented. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
