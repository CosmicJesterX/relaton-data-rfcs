abstract:
  content: This document describes a mechanism to allow IS-IS routing to quickly and
    accurately shift traffic away from either a point-to-point or multi-access LAN
    interface during network maintenance or other operational events.  This is accomplished
    by signaling adjacent IS-IS neighbors with a higher reverse metric, i.e., the
    metric towards the signaling IS-IS router.
