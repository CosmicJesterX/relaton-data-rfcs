abstract:
  content: This document describes two reference video traffic models for evaluating
    RTP congestion control algorithms.  The first model statistically characterizes
    the behavior of a live video encoder in response to changing requests on the target
    video rate.  The second model is trace-driven and emulates the output of actual
    encoded video frame sizes from a high-resolution test sequence.  Both models are
    designed to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability, and authenticity
    in modeling the interactions between a live video traffic source and the congestion
    control module.  Finally, the document describes how both approaches can be combined
    into a hybrid model.
