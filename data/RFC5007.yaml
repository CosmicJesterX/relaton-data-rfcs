    Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) that can be used to obtain lease information about
    DHCPv6 clients from a DHCPv6 server.  This document specifies the scope of data
    that can be retrieved as well as both DHCPv6 leasequery requestor and server behavior.  This
    document extends DHCPv6. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
