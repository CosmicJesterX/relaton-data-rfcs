abstract:
  content: This document updates the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in RFC 4090 to support Packet
    Switch Capable (PSC) Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs).  These updates allow the coordination of a bidirectional bypass
    tunnel assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse directions
    of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.  In addition, these updates enable the redirection
    of bidirectional traffic onto bypass tunnels that ensure the co-routing of data
    paths in the forward and reverse directions after FRR and avoid RSVP soft-state
    timeout in the control plane.
