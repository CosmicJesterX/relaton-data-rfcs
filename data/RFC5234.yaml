abstract:
- content: Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over
    the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF
    (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification
    documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational
    power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition,
    alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies
    additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type
    common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
