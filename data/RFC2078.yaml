abstract:
- content: The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), as
    defined in RFC-1508, provides security services to callers in a generic fashion,
    supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing
    source-level portability of applications to different environments. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
