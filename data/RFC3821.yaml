abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel Over TCP/IP (FCIP) describes mechanisms that allow the interconnection
    of islands of Fibre Channel storage area networks over IP-based networks to form
    a unified storage area network in a single Fibre Channel fabric.  FCIP relies
    on IP-based network services to provide the connectivity between the storage area
    network islands over local area networks, metropolitan area networks, or wide
    area networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
