abstract:
  content: 'This document is an account of the rationale behind the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
    Route Optimization security design. The purpose of this document is to present
    the thinking and to preserve the reasoning behind the Mobile IPv6 security design
    in 2001 - 2002. The document has two target audiences: (1) helping MIPv6 implementors
    to better understand the design choices in MIPv6 security procedures, and (2)
    allowing people dealing with mobility or multi-homing to avoid a number of potential
    security pitfalls in their designs. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.'
