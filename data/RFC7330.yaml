abstract:
- content: This document defines two Management Information Base (MIB) modules that
    contain Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS
    (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD-related MIB modules that would otherwise
    define their own representations.
