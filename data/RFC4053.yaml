abstract:
- content: This document describes the procedure for proper handling of incoming liaison
    statements from other standards development organizations (SDOs), consortia, and
    industry fora, and for generating liaison statements to be transmitted from IETF
    to other SDOs, consortia and industry fora. This procedure allows IETF to effectively
    collaborate with other organizations in the international standards community.
    The IETF expects that liaison statements might come from a variety of organizations,
    and it may choose to respond to many of those. The IETF is only obligated to respond
    if there is an agreed liaison relationship, however. This document specifies an
    Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.
