abstract:
- content: This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties,
    and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring
    Protocol.  This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists
    that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such
    as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal.  A
    lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration
    of a wide range of user management repositories.  Search operations allow discovery
    and manipulation of principals using human names. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
