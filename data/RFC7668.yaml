abstract:
  content: Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy feature
    in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.  The
    standard Bluetooth radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile phones,
    notebook computers, audio headsets, and many other devices.  The low-power version
    of Bluetooth is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with
    devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low-power variant
    of Bluetooth has been standardized since revision 4.0 of the Bluetooth specifications,
    although version 4.1 or newer is required for IPv6.  This document describes how
    IPv6 is transported over Bluetooth low energy using IPv6 over Low-power Wireless
    Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) techniques.
