abstract:
- content: In this document, a number of popular extensions to the Network News Transfer
    Protocol (NNTP) protocol defined in RFC 977 are documented and discussed.  While
    this document is not intended to serve as a standard of any kind, it will hopefully
    serve as a reference document for future implementers of the NNTP protocol.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
