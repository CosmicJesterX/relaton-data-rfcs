abstract:
  content: This document updates RFC 5104 by fixing a shortcoming in the specification
    language of the Codec Control Message Full Intra Request (FIR) description when
    using it with layered codecs.  In particular, a decoder refresh point needs to
    be sent by a media sender when a FIR is received on any layer of the layered bitstream,
    regardless of whether those layers are being sent in a single or in multiple RTP
    flows.  The other payload-specific feedback messages defined in RFC 5104 and RFC
    4585 (which was updated by RFC 5506) have also been analyzed, and no corresponding
    shortcomings have been found.
