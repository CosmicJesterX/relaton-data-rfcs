abstract:
  content: Two separate models for conveying instant messages have been defined.  Page-mode
    messages stand alone and are not part of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) session,
    whereas session-mode messages are set up as part of a session using SIP.  The
    Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is a protocol for near real-time, peer-to-peer
    exchanges of binary content without intermediaries, which is designed to be signaled
    using a separate rendezvous protocol such as SIP.  This document introduces the
    notion of message relay intermediaries to MSRP and describes the extensions necessary
    to use them. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
