abstract:
  content: 'The transition from a pure IPv4 network to a network where IPv4 and IPv6
    coexist brings a number of extra security considerations that need to be taken
    into account when deploying IPv6 and operating the dual-protocol network and the
    associated transition mechanisms. This document attempts to give an overview of
    the various issues grouped into three categories: o issues due to the IPv6 protocol
    itself, o issues due to transition mechanisms, and o issues due to IPv6 deployment.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.'
