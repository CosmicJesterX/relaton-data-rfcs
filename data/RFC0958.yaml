abstract:
- content: This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a protocol for
    synchronizing a set of network clocks using a set of distributed clients and servers.  NTP
    is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless
    transport mechanism.  It is evolved from the Time Protocol and the ICMP Timestamp
    message and is a suitable replacement for both.  This RFC suggests a proposed
    protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.
