abstract:
  content: Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
    related security protocols. Weak or predictable "cryptographically secure" pseudorandom
    number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes.
    An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken as well,
    which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This document
    describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their CSPRNGs
    using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or otherwise
    subverted CSPRNGs. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group
    (CFRG) in the IRTF.
