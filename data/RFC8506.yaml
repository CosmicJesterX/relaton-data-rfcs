abstract:
  content: This document specifies a Diameter application that can be used to implement
    real-time credit-control for a variety of end-user services such as network access,
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services, messaging services, and download services.  The
    Diameter Credit- Control application as defined in this document obsoletes RFC
    4006, and it must be supported by all new Diameter Credit-Control application
    implementations.
