abstract:
  content: The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established
    in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved in ways that required
    changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this RFC is to document
    and describe the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2.0 (IASA 2.0).
    It defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC Board
    (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society in the
    fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process. It also defines
    the membership and selection rules for the IETF LLC Board. This document obsoletes
    RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.
