abstract:
  content: Many network devices support parallel packet processing.  This document
    describes how Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) can model a network
    device's parallelization datapath using constructs defined by the ForCES model
    (RFC 5812) and controlled via the ForCES protocol (RFC 5810).
