abstract:
- content: This document presents a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) in an OSPF area.  A
    TTZ comprises a group of routers and a number of links connecting these routers.  Any
    router outside of the zone is not aware of the zone.  A TTZ hides the internal
    topology of the TTZ from the outside.  It does not directly advertise any internal
    information about the TTZ to a router outside of the TTZ.  The information about
    the links and routers such as a link down inside the TTZ is not advertised to
    any router outside of the TTZ.
