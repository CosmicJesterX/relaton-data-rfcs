abstract:
- content: The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for
    providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols
    via replaceable mechanisms. It provides a structured interface between protocols
    and mechanisms. The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing
    mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms. The framework
    also provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol exchanges within a data
    security layer. This document describes how a SASL mechanism is structured, describes
    how protocols include support for SASL, and defines the protocol for carrying
    a data security layer over a connection. In addition, this document defines one
    SASL mechanism, the EXTERNAL mechanism. This document obsoletes RFC 2222. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
