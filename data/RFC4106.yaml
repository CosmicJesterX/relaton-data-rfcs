abstract:
- content: This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in
    Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as an IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) mechanism
    to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication.  This method can be
    efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above,
    and is also well-suited to software implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
