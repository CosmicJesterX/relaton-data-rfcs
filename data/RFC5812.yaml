abstract:
  content: This document defines the forwarding element (FE) model used in the Forwarding
    and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol.  The model represents the capabilities,
    state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES
    protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.  More
    specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present in an
    FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or
    can be interconnected.  This FE model is intended to satisfy the model requirements
    specified in RFC 3654. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
