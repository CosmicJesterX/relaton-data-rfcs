abstract:
- content: The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network access or IP mobility
    in both local and roaming situations.  This document specifies the message format,
    transport, error reporting, accounting, and security services used by all Diameter
    applications.  The Diameter base protocol as defined in this document obsoletes
    RFC 3588 and RFC 5719, and it must be supported by all new Diameter implementations.
