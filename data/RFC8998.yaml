abstract:
  content: This document specifies how to use the ShangMi (SM) cryptographic algorithms
    with Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3. The use of these algorithms
    with TLS 1.3 is not endorsed by the IETF. The SM algorithms are becoming mandatory
    in China, so this document provides a description of how to use the SM algorithms
    with TLS 1.3 and specifies a profile of TLS 1.3 so that implementers can produce
    interworking implementations.
