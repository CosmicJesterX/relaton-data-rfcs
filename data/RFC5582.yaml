abstract:
  content: This document describes an architecture for a global, scalable, resilient,
    and administratively distributed system for mapping geographic location information
    to URLs, using the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol.  The architecture
    generalizes well-known approaches found in hierarchical lookup systems such as
    DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
