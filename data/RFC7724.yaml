abstract:
- content: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has been extended
    with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to request information about
    DHCPv4 bindings (RFC 4388).  That mechanism is limited to queries for individual
    bindings.  In some situations, individual binding queries may not be efficient,
    or even possible.  In addition, continuous update of an external requestor with
    Leasequery data is sometimes desired.  This document expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery
    protocol, and allows for active transfer of near real-time DHCPv4 binding information
    data via TCP.  This document updates RFC 6926, "DHCPv4 Bulk Leasequery".
