abstract:
  content: This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) re-authentication problem
    statement.  The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying framework
    is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers without re-executing
    an EAP method.  This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless
    environments.  This document details the problem and defines design goals for
    a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
