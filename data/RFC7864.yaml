abstract:
  content: Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) allows a mobile node to connect to the same
    PMIPv6 domain through different interfaces. This document describes extensions
    to the PMIPv6 protocol that are required to support network-based flow mobility
    over multiple physical interfaces. This document updates RFC 5213. The extensions
    described in this document consist of the operations performed by the local mobility
    anchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the prefixes assigned to the different
    interfaces of the mobile node, as well as how the forwarding policies are handled
    by the network to ensure consistent flow mobility management.
