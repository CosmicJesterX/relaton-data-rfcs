abstract:
  content: In some instances, Service Providers (SPs) have a legal logging requirement
    to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public
    Internet (e.g., for abuse response).  Unfortunately, many logging solutions for
    Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) require active logging of dynamic translations.  CGN
    port assignments are often per connection, but they could optionally use port
    ranges.  Research indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many
    residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to manage CGN translations
    in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while
    providing traceability for abuse response.  IPv6 is, of course, the preferred
    solution.  While deployment is in progress, SPs are forced by business imperatives
    to maintain support for IPv4.  This note addresses the IPv4 part of the network
    when a CGN solution is in use.
