abstract:
  content: IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) are formed
    by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, neither
    the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format specification defines how mesh
    topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, it should be considered how
    6LoWPAN formation and multi-hop routing could be supported. This document provides
    the problem statement and design space for 6LoWPAN routing. It defines the routing
    requirements for 6LoWPANs, considering the low-power and other particular characteristics
    of the devices and links. The purpose of this document is not to recommend specific
    solutions but to provide general, layer-agnostic guidelines about the design of
    6LoWPAN routing that can lead to further analysis and protocol design. This document
    is intended as input to groups working on routing protocols relevant to 6LoWPANs,
    such as the IETF ROLL WG. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
