abstract:
  content: A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) have
    been proposed.  Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization.  It
    is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future.  This document
    defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements at session initialization
    time, as well as a mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after LDP session
    establishment. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
