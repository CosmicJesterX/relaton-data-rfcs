abstract:
- content: Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network Interconnection
    (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream
    CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This
    document defines extensions to the CDNI Metadata Interface (MI) and the Footprint
    & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI).  These extensions are derived from
    requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases
    in general.
