abstract:
  content: This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking
    (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast
    data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded
    latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane
    resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate
    nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows
    that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing
    data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each
    packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer
    and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive
    Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.
