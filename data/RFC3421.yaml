abstract:
  content: This document defines two extensions (Select and Sort) for the Service
    Location Protocol (SLP).  These extensions allow a User Agent (UA) to request
    that the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) entries in a Service Reply (SrvRply) be
    limited to the specified number, or be sorted according to the specified sort
    key list.  Using these two extensions together can facilitate discovering the
    best match, such as finding a service that has the maximum speed or the minimum
    load.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
