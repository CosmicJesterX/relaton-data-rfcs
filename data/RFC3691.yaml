abstract:
- content: This document defines an UNSELECT command that can be used to close the
    current mailbox in an Internet Message Access Protocol - version 4 (IMAP4) session
    without expunging it.  Certain types of IMAP clients need to release resources
    associated with the selected mailbox without selecting a different mailbox.  While
    IMAP4 provides this functionality (via a SELECT command with a nonexistent mailbox
    name or reselecting the same mailbox with EXAMINE command), a more clean solution
    is desirable. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
