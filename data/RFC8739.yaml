abstract:
  content: Public key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised, that
    is, when the associated private key is exposed to an unauthorized entity.  However,
    the revocation process is often unreliable.  An alternative to revocation is issuing
    a sequence of certificates, each with a short validity period, and terminating
    the sequence upon compromise.  This memo proposes an Automated Certificate Management
    Environment (ACME) extension to enable the issuance of Short-Term, Automatically
    Renewed (STAR) X.509 certificates.
