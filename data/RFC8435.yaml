abstract:
  content: Parallel NFS (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto a metadata
    server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.  The flexible file layout
    type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS that allows the use of
    storage devices that require only a limited degree of interaction with the metadata
    server and use already-existing protocols.  Client-side mirroring is also added
    to provide replication of files.
