abstract:
  content: This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram Congestion
    Control Protocol, RFC 4340.  It motivates the setting of a Service Code by applications.  Service
    Codes provide a method to identify the intended service/application to process
    a DCCP connection request.  This provides improved flexibility in the use and
    assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing.  The use of a DCCP Service
    Code can also enable more explicit coordination of services with middleboxes (e.g.,
    network address translators and firewalls).  This document updates the specification
    provided in RFC 4340. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
