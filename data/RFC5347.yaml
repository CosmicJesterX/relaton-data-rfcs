abstract:
  content: This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) package to
    support fax calls.  The package allows for fax calls to be supported in two different
    ways.  The first one utilizes ITU-T Recommendation T.38 for fax relay under the
    control of the Call Agent.  The second one lets the gateway decide upon a method
    for fax transmission as well as handle the details of the fax call without Call
    Agent involvement.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
