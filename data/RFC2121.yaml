abstract:
  content: This document provides a qualitative look at the issues constraining a

    distribution of cluster members, and the use of VC Mesh or MCS modes to support
    multicast groups.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This
    memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
