abstract:
- content: This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain Style
    Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is a partial update of RFC 881.  The
    intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for the implementation for the Domain
    Style Naming System.  The names of hosts will be changed to domain style names.  Hosts
    will begin to use domain style names on 14-Mar-84, and the use of old style names
    will be completely phased out before 2-May-84.  This applies to both the ARPA
    research hosts and the DDN operational hosts.  This is an official policy statement
    of the ICCB and the DARPA.
