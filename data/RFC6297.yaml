abstract:
  content: This document provides a survey of transport protocols that are designed
    to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard
    TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it.  Such protocols could be used
    for delay-insensitive "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes
    called a "less than" (or "lower than") best-effort service.  This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
