abstract:
- content: The current Internet climate poses serious threats to the Domain Name System.
    In the interim period before the DNS protocol can be secured more fully, measures
    can already be taken to harden the DNS to make 'spoofing' a recursing nameserver
    many orders of magnitude harder. Even a cryptographically secured DNS benefits
    from having the ability to discard bogus responses quickly, as this potentially
    saves large amounts of computation. By describing certain behavior that has previously
    not been standardized, this document sets out how to make the DNS more resilient
    against accepting incorrect responses. This document updates RFC 2181. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
