abstract:
  content: The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) allows a Centralized
    Conferencing (XCON) system client to create, retrieve, change, and delete objects
    that describe a centralized conference.  CCMP is a means to control basic and
    advanced conference features such as conference state and capabilities, participants,
    relative roles, and details.  CCMP is a stateless, XML-based, client server protocol
    that carries, in its request and response messages, conference information in
    the form of XML documents and fragments conforming to the centralized conferencing
    data model schema. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
