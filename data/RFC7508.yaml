abstract:
  content: This document describes how the S/MIME protocol can be extended in order
    to secure message header fields defined in RFC 5322.  This technology provides
    security services such as data integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality.  This
    extension is referred to as 'Secure Headers'.
