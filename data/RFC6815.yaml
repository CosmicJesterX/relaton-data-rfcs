abstract:
  content: The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) has been developing key
    performance metrics and laboratory test methods since 1990, and continues this
    work at present.  The methods described in RFC 2544 are intended to generate traffic
    that overloads network device resources in order to assess their capacity.  Overload
    of shared resources would likely be harmful to user traffic performance on a production
    network, and there are further negative consequences identified with production
    application of the methods.  This memo clarifies the scope of RFC 2544 and other
    IETF BMWG benchmarking work for isolated test environments only, and it encourages
    new standards activity for measurement methods applicable outside that scope.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
