abstract:
  content: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable delivery of data
    across any network path, including network paths containing satellite channels.  While
    TCP works over satellite channels there are several IETF standardized mechanisms
    that enable TCP to more effectively utilize the available capacity of the network
    path.  This document outlines some of these TCP mitigations.  This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.
