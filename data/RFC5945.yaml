abstract:
  content: The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to make end-to- end
    resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the quality of service
    required by certain flows.  RSVP assumes that both the data sender and receiver
    of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource
    reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.  This
    document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to initiate or terminate
    RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable.  This
    allows resource reservations to be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end
    path.  This document reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies
    and discusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application requirements,
    despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating in RSVP.  This document
    also points out where extensions to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed
    for deployment of a given RSVP proxy approach.  However, such extensions are outside
    the scope of this document.  Finally, practical use cases for RSVP proxy are described.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
