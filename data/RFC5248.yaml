abstract:
  content: The specification for enhanced mail system status codes, RFC 3463, establishes
    a new code model and lists a collection of status codes.  While it anticipated
    that more codes would be added over time, it did not provide an explicit mechanism
    for registering and tracking those codes.  This document specifies an IANA registry
    for mail system enhanced status codes, and initializes that registry with the
    codes so far established in published standards-track documents, as well as other
    codes that have become established in the industry.  This document specifies an
    Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.
