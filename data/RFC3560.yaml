abstract:
  content: This document describes the conventions for using the RSAES-OAEP key transport
    algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The CMS specifies the
    enveloped-data content type, which consists of an encrypted content and encrypted
    content-encryption keys for one or more recipients.  The RSAES-OAEP key transport
    algorithm can be used to encrypt content-encryption keys for intended recipients.
