abstract:
- content: This document is an update to the original `ripe-81' proposal for representing
    and storing routing polices within the RIPE database.  It incorporates several
    extensions proposed by Merit Inc.  and gives details of a generalized IP routing
    policy representation to be used by all Internet routing registries.  It acts
    as both tutorial and provides details of database objects and attributes that
    use and make up a routing registry.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
