abstract:
- content: This document specifies Version 1.0 of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) protocol.  The DTLS protocol provides communications privacy for datagram
    protocols.  The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a
    way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  The
    DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides
    equivalent security guarantees.  Datagram semantics of the underlying transport
    are preserved by the DTLS protocol.
