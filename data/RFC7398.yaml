abstract:
  content: This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of Broadband
    Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for commonly used performance
    metrics.  Other similar measurement projects may also be able to use the extensions
    described here for measurement point location.  The purpose is to create an efficient
    way to describe the location of the measurement point(s) used to conduct a particular
    measurement.
