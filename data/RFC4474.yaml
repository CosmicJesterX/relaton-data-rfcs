abstract:
- content: The existing security mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    are inadequate for cryptographically assuring the identity of the end users that
    originate SIP requests, especially in an interdomain context.  This document defines
    a mechanism for securely identifying originators of SIP messages.  It does so
    by defining two new SIP header fields, Identity, for conveying a signature used
    for validating the identity, and Identity-Info, for conveying a reference to the
    certificate of the signer. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
