abstract:
- content: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is being extended to the edge of operator
    networks including the network access nodes.  Separately, network access nodes
    such as Passive Optical Network (PON) Optical Line Terminations (OLTs) have evolved
    to support first-mile access protection, where one or more physical OLTs provide
    first-mile diversity to the customer edge.  Multihoming support is needed on the
    MPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services.  This document
    describes the Multi-Chassis PON (MC-PON) protection architecture in MPLS and also
    specifies the Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) extension to support
    it.
