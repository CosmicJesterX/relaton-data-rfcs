abstract:
  content: Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domains
    via the Local Mobility Anchors by deploying Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
    proxy functions at Mobile Access Gateways, by using direct traffic distribution
    within an ISP's access network, or by selective route optimization schemes.  This
    document describes a base solution and an experimental protocol to support mobile
    multicast senders in PMIPv6 domains for all three scenarios.  Protocol optimizations
    for synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as a peering function for MLD proxies
    are defined.  Mobile sources always remain agnostic of multicast mobility operations.
