abstract:
- content: This document specifies the Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol
    (GSAKMP).  The GSAKMP provides a security framework for creating and managing
    cryptographic groups on a network.  It provides mechanisms to disseminate group
    policy and authenticate users, rules to perform access control decisions during
    group establishment and recovery, capabilities to recover from the compromise
    of group members, delegation of group security functions, and capabilities to
    destroy the group.  It also generates group keys. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
