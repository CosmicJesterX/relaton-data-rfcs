abstract:
  content: This document specifies a Password-Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling
    (J-PAKE) protocol.  This protocol allows the establishment of a secure end-to-end
    communication channel between two remote parties over an insecure network solely
    based on a shared password, without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    or any trusted third party.
