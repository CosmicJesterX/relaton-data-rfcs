abstract:
  content: One of the most important Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
    capabilities for transport-network operation is fault localization.  An in-service,
    on-demand path segment monitoring function of a transport path is indispensable,
    particularly when the service monitoring function is activated only between endpoints.  However,
    the current segment monitoring approach defined for MPLS (including the MPLS Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP)) in RFC 6371 "Operations, Administration, and Maintenance Framework
    for MPLS-Based Transport Networks" has drawbacks.  This document provides an analysis
    of the existing MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms for the path segment monitoring and provides
    requirements to guide the development of new OAM tools to support Hitless Path
    Segment Monitoring (HPSM).
