abstract:
  content: This memo defines a generalized mechanism for application service naming
    that allows service location without relying on rigid domain naming conventions
    (so-called name hacks).  The proposal defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System
    (DDDS) Application to map domain name, application service name, and application
    protocol dynamically to target server and port. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
