abstract:
- content: This document specifies the process that Certification Authorities (CAs)
    and Relying Parties (RPs) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically
    stronger) algorithm set.  The process is expected to be completed over a timescale
    of several years.  Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.  The transition
    procedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration (parent
    migrates before children).
