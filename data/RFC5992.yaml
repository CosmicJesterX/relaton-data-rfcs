abstract:
  content: This document is a guideline for registries and registrars on registering
    internationalized domain names (IDNs) based on (in alphabetical order) Bosnian,
    Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Kildin Sami, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian,
    and Ukrainian languages in a DNS zone.  It describes appropriate characters for
    registration and variant considerations for characters from Greek and Latin scripts
    with similar appearances and/or derivations.  This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
