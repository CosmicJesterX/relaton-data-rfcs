abstract:
  content: This document suggests a method of using DNS to determine the network that
    contains a specified IP address, the netmask of that network, and the address(es)
    of first-hop routers(s) on that network.  This method supports variable-length
    subnet masks, delegation of subnets on non-octet boundaries, and multiple routers
    per subnet.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
