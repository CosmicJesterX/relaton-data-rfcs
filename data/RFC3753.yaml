abstract:
- content: There is a need for common definitions of terminology in the work to be
    done around IP mobility.  This document defines terms for mobility related terminology.  The
    document originated out of work done in the Seamoby Working Group but has broader
    applicability for terminology used in IETF-wide discourse on technology for mobility
    and IP networks.  Other working groups dealing with mobility may want to take
    advantage of this terminology.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
