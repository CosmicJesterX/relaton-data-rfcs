abstract:
  content: This document describes the application of MPLS multi-segment pseudowires
    (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a Passive Optical Network
    (PON) and an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN). PON technology may be used in
    mobile backhaul networks to support the end segments closest to the aggregation
    devices. In these cases, there may be a very large number of pseudowire (PW) Terminating
    Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes. The MPLS control plane could be used to provision
    these end segments, but support for the necessary protocols would complicate the
    management of the T-PEs and would significantly increase their expense. Alternatively,
    static, or management plane, configuration could be used to configure the end
    segments, but the very large number of such segments in a PON places a very heavy
    burden on the network manager. This document describes how to set up the end segment
    of an end-to- end MPLS PW over a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (G-PON)
    or 10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) using the G-PON and XG-PON
    management protocol, Optical Network Termination Management and Control Interface
    (OMCI). This simplifies and speeds up PW provisioning compared with manual configuration.
    This document also shows how an MS-PW may be constructed from an end segment supported
    over a PON, and switched to one or more segments supported over an MPLS PSN. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
