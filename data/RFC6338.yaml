abstract:
  content: This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for the
    Schema for Academia (SCHAC). The namespace described in this document is for naming
    persistent resources defined by the SCHAC participants internationally, their
    working groups, and other designated subordinates. The main use of this namespace
    will be for the creation of controlled vocabulary values for attributes in the
    SCHAC schema. These values will be associated with particular instances of persons
    or objects belonging to any of the SCHAC object classes. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
