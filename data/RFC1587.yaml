abstract:
  content: This document describes a new optional type of OSPF area, somewhat humorously
    referred to as a "not-so-stubby" area (or NSSA).  NSSAs are similar to the existing
    OSPF stub area configuration option but have the additional capability of importing
    AS external routes in a limited fashion. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
