abstract:
- content: This document describes the implementation of Apple Inc.'s Back to My Mac
    (BTMM) service.  BTMM provides network connectivity between devices so that a
    user can perform file sharing and screen sharing among multiple computers at home,
    at work, or on the road.  The implementation of BTMM addresses the issues of single
    sign-on authentication, secure data communication, service discovery, and end-to-end
    connectivity in the face of Network Address Translators (NATs) and mobility of
    devices.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
