abstract:
  content: An examination of a synchronization problem in the Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP) is presented.  This synchronization problem can cause a message
    to be delivered multiple times.  A method for avoiding this problem is suggested.  Nodding
    familiarity with the SMTP specification, RFC-821, is required.
