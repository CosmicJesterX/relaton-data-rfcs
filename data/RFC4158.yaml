abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance and recommendations to developers building
    X.509 public-key certification paths within their applications.  By following
    the guidance and recommendations defined in this document, an application developer
    is more likely to develop a robust X.509 certificate-enabled application that
    can build valid certification paths across a wide range of PKI environments.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
