abstract:
- content: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents.  This
    framework defines the procedures for creating, refreshing, and terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures
    provide no tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have already been
    received by a user agent.  This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows
    the subscriber to condition the subscription request to whether the state has
    changed since the previous notification was received.  When such a condition is
    true, either the body of a resulting event notification or the entire notification
    message is suppressed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
