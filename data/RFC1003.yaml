abstract:
- content: This memo is intended to identify and explore issues in defining a standard
    for the exchange of mathematical equations.  No attempt is made at a complete
    definition and more questions are asked than are answered.  Questions about the
    user interface are only addressed to the extent that they affect interchange issues.
