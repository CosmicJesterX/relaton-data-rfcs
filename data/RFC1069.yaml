abstract:
  content: This RFC suggests an addressing scheme for use with the ISO Connectionless
    Network Protocol (CLNP) in the Internet.  This is a solution to one of the problems
    inherent in the use of "ISO-grams" in the Internet.  This memo is a revision of
    RFC 986.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community, and
    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
