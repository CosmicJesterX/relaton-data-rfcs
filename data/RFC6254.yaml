abstract:
- content: RFC 2754 requested that each time IANA made an address assignment, it was
    to create appropriate inetnum and as-block objects and digitally sign them.  The
    purpose was to distribute the IANA-held public key in software implementations
    of the Distributed Routing Policy System.  In practice, this was never done on
    the public Internet.  This document requests that RFC 2754 be moved to Historic
    status.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
