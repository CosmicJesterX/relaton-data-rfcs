abstract:
  content: The IETF has developed a one-way packet loss metric that measures the loss
    rate on a Poisson and Periodic probe streams between two hosts.  However, the
    impact of packet loss on applications is, in general, sensitive not just to the
    average loss rate but also to the way in which packet losses are distributed in
    loss episodes (i.e., maximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets).  This
    document defines one-way packet loss episode metrics, specifically, the frequency
    and average duration of loss episodes and a probing methodology under which the
    loss episode metrics are to be measured. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
