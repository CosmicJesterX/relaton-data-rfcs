abstract:
  content: 'This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the Dual- Stack
    Lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits of deploying IPv6
    in service provider networks.  Dual-Stack Lite enables a broadband service provider
    to share IPv4 addresses among customers by combining two well-known technologies:
    IP in IP (IPv4- in-IPv6) and Network Address Translation (NAT). [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
