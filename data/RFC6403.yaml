- content: The United States government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite\0B
    Cryptography", which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security
    applications.  This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management
    over CMS (CMC) protocol for managing Suite B X.509 public key certificates.  This
    profile is a refinement of RFCs 5272, 5273, and 5274.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
