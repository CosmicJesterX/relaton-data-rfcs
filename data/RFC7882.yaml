abstract:
- content: This document describes various use cases for Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (S-BFD) and provides requirements such that protocol mechanisms allow
    for simplified detection of forwarding failures. These use cases support S-BFD,
    which is a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of negotiation
    aspects eliminated, accelerating the establishment of a BFD session. The benefits
    of S-BFD include quick provisioning, as well as improved control and flexibility
    for network nodes initiating path monitoring.
