abstract:
- content: This report contains a discussion of the difficult problem of key management
    for multicast communication sessions.  It focuses on two main areas of concern
    with respect to key management, which are, initializing the multicast group with
    a common net key and rekeying the multicast group.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
