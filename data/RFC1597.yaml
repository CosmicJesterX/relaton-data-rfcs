abstract:
- content: This RFC describes methods to preserve IP address space by not allocating
    globally unique IP addresses to hosts private to an enterprise while still permitting
    full network layer connectivity between all hosts inside an enterprise as well
    as between all public hosts of different enterprises.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.
