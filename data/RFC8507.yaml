abstract:
- content: This document is published for the historical record. The Simple Internet
    Protocol was the basis for one of the candidates for the IETF's Next Generation
    (IPng) work that became IPv6. The publication date of the original Internet-Draft
    was November 10, 1992. It is presented here substantially unchanged and is neither
    a complete document nor intended to be implementable. The paragraph that follows
    is the Abstract from the original draft. This document specifies a new version
    of IP called SIP, the Simple Internet Protocol. It also describes the changes
    needed to ICMP, IGMP, and transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, in order to
    work with SIP. A companion document [SIP-ADDR] describes the addressing and routing
    aspects of SIP, including issues of auto-configuration, host and subnet mobility,
    and multicast.
