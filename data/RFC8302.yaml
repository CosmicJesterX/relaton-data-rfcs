abstract:
  content: This document describes mechanisms to optimize the Address Resolution Protocol
    (ARP) and Neighbor Discovery (ND) traffic in a Transparent Interconnection of
    Lots of Links (TRILL) campus.  TRILL switches maintain a cache of IP / Media Access
    Control (MAC) address / Data Label bindings that are learned from ARP/ND requests
    and responses that pass through them.  In many cases, this cache allows an edge
    Routing Bridge (RBridge) to avoid flooding an ARP/ND request by either responding
    to it directly or encapsulating it and unicasting it.  Such optimization reduces
    packet flooding over a TRILL campus.
