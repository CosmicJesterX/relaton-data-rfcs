abstract:
- content: This document describes procedures to damp Multicast VPN (MVPN) routing
    state changes and control the effect of the churn due to the multicast dynamicity
    in customer sites.  The procedures described in this document are applicable to
    BGP-based multicast VPN and help avoid uncontrolled control-plane load increase
    in the core routing infrastructure.  The new procedures proposed were inspired
    by BGP unicast route damping principles that have been adapted to multicast.
