abstract:
  content: The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component of
    the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual authentication as well as
    to establish and to maintain IPsec Security Associations (SAs) between the respective
    parties. IKEv2 supports several different authentication mechanisms, such as the
    Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and Shared Key (SK). Diameter
    interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent (HA), as a Diameter client,
    and the Diameter server has been specified. However, that specification focused
    on the usage of EAP and did not include support for SK-based authentication available
    with IKEv2. This document specifies the IKEv2-server-to-Diameter-server communication
    when the IKEv2 peer authenticates using IKEv2 with SK. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
