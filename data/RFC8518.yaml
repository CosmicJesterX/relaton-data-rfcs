abstract:
- content: Deployment experience gained from implementing algorithms to determine
    Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs) for multi-homed prefixes (MHPs) has revealed some
    avenues for potential improvement.  This document provides explicit inequalities
    that can be used to evaluate neighbors as potential alternates for MHPs.  It also
    provides detailed criteria for evaluating potential alternates for external prefixes
    advertised by OSPF ASBRs.  This document updates Section 6 of RFC 5286 by expanding
    some of the routing aspects.
