abstract:
  content: The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed
    to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and Internet
    communities while permitting the authors to retain as many rights as possible.  This
    memo details the IETF policies on rights in Contributions to the IETF.  It also
    describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates
    RFC 2026, and, with RFC 3668, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.
