abstract:
  content: Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer
    addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability
    information.  This document updates RFC 4861 to allow routers to proactively create
    a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node.  It also
    updates RFC 4861 and recommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements
    upon assigning a new IPv6 address.  These changes will minimize the delay and
    packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link destination from
    a new IPv6 address.
