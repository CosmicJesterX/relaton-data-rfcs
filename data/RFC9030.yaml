abstract:
  content: This document describes a network architecture that provides low-latency,
    low-jitter, and high-reliability packet delivery.  It combines a high-speed powered
    backbone and subnetworks using IEEE 802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH)
    to meet the requirements of low-power wireless deterministic applications.
