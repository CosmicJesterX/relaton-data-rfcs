abstract:
- content: This document defines requirements for standards specifications for Energy
    Management. The requirements defined in this document are concerned with monitoring
    functions as well as control functions. Monitoring functions include identifying
    energy-managed devices and their components, as well as monitoring their Power
    States, Power Inlets, Power Outlets, actual power, Power Attributes, received
    energy, provided energy, and contained batteries. Control functions include such
    functions as controlling power supply and Power State of energy-managed devices
    and their components. This document does not specify the features that must be
    implemented by compliant implementations but rather lists features that must be
    supported by standards for Energy Management.
