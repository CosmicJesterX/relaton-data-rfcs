abstract:
  content: This document describes the RTP payload format of a mU-law EMbedded Coder
    for Low-delay IP communication (UEMCLIP), an enhanced speech codec of ITU-T G.711.  The
    bitstream has a scalable structure with an embedded u-law bitstream, also known
    as PCMU, thus providing a handy transcoding operation between narrowband and wideband
    speech. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
