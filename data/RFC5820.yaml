abstract:
  content: This document describes extensions to OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANETs).  The extensions, called OSPF-OR (OSPF-Overlapping Relay), include mechanisms
    for link-local signaling (LLS), an OSPF-MANET interface, a simple technique to
    reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting incremental state changes,
    and a method for optimized flooding of routing updates.  OSPF-OR also provides
    a means to reduce unnecessary adjacencies to support larger MANETs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
