abstract:
  content: When multiple congestion-controlled Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
    sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their controls can improve
    the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of delay, loss, and fairness.  This document
    describes such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way that is
    as flexible and simple as possible while minimizing the number of changes needed
    to existing RTP applications.  This document also specifies how to apply the method
    for the Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) congestion control algorithm
    and provides suggestions on how to apply it to other congestion control algorithms.
