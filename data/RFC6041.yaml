abstract:
- content: The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol defines
    a standard framework and mechanism for the interconnection between control elements
    and forwarding elements in IP routers and similar devices.  In this document we
    describe the applicability of the ForCES model and protocol.  We provide example
    deployment scenarios and functionality, as well as document applications that
    would be inappropriate for ForCES.  This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
