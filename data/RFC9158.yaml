abstract:
- content: RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned by the Public
    Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group in an arc that was allocated
    by IANA (1.3.6.1.5.5.7).  A small number of object identifiers that were assigned
    in RFC 4212 are omitted from RFC 7299, and this document updates RFC 7299 to correct
    that oversight.
