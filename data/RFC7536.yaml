abstract:
- content: Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network
    diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public policy.  Understanding
    the various scenarios and users of measuring broadband performance is essential
    to development of the Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP)
    framework, information model, and protocol.  This document details two use cases
    that can assist in developing that framework.  The details of the measurement
    metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.
