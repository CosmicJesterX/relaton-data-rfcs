abstract:
  content: The YANG data modeling language is currently being considered for a wide
    variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large. Many standards
    development organizations (SDOs), open-source software projects, vendors, and
    users are using YANG to develop and publish YANG modules for a wide variety of
    applications. At the same time, there is currently no well-known terminology to
    categorize various types of YANG modules. A consistent terminology would help
    with the categorization of YANG modules, assist in the analysis of the YANG data
    modeling efforts in the IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the
    YANG- related discussions between the different groups. This document describes
    a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent classification of
    YANG modules.
