abstract:
- content: This document specifies an extension to the Distributed Denial-of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol so that DOTS clients can
    control their filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active. Particularly,
    this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or deactivate existing filtering
    rules during a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. The characterization
    of these filtering rules is conveyed by a DOTS client during an 'idle' time (i.e.,
    no mitigation is active) by means of the DOTS data channel protocol.
