abstract:
  content: Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF, the
    non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented and used for
    conveying call-diversion-related information in SIP signaling. This document describes
    a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header and the History-Info
    header to handle call diversion information. In addition, an interworking policy
    is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence. The History-Info header is described
    in RFC 4244 and the non-standard Diversion header is described, as Historic, in
    RFC 5806. Since the Diversion header is used in many existing network implementations
    for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP
    History-Info standardized solution is needed. This work is intended to enable
    the migration from non- standard implementations and deployment toward IETF specification-
    based implementations and deployment. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
