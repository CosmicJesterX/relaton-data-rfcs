abstract:
  content: The OpenLDAP Project is operating an experimental LDAP (Lightweight Directory
    Access Protocol) referral service known as the "OpenLDAP Root Service".  The automated
    system generates referrals based upon service location information published in
    DNS SRV RRs (Domain Name System location of services resource records).  This
    document describes this service.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for
    the Internet community.
