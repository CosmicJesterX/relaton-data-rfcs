abstract:
  content: This document defines an authorization policy language for controlling
    access to location information. It extends the Common Policy authorization framework
    to provide location-specific access control. More specifically, this document
    defines condition elements specific to location information in order to restrict
    access to data based on the current location of the Target. Furthermore, this
    document defines two algorithms for reducing the granularity of returned location
    information. The first algorithm is defined for usage with civic location information,
    whereas the other one applies to geodetic location information. Both algorithms
    come with limitations. There are circumstances where the amount of location obfuscation
    provided is less than what is desired. These algorithms might not be appropriate
    for all application domains. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
