abstract:
  content: The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol has, until
    now, required the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the underlying transport layer.  This
    document defines RADIUS over the Transmission Control Protocol (RADIUS/TCP), in
    order to address handling issues related to RADIUS over Transport Layer Security
    (RADIUS/TLS).  It permits TCP to be used as a transport protocol for RADIUS only
    when a transport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides confidentiality and security.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
