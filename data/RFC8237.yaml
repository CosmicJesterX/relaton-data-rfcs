abstract:
  content: This document describes a method for generating an aggregated pseudowire
    (PW) status message transmitted for a statically configured PW on a Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) to indicate the status of one
    or more PWs carried on the LSP. The method for transmitting the PW status information
    is not new; however, this protocol extension allows a Service Provider (SP) to
    reliably monitor the individual PW status while not overwhelming the network with
    multiple periodic status messages. This is achieved by sending a single cumulative
    summary status verification message for all the PWs grouped in the same LSP.
