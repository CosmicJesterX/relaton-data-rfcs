abstract:
  content: RPS Security requires certain RPSL objects in the IRR to be hierarchically
    delegated.  The set of objects that are at the root of this hierarchy needs to
    be created and digitally signed by IANA.  This paper presents these seed objects
    and lists operations required from IANA.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
