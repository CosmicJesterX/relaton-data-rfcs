abstract:
  content: HTTP Digest, as specified in RFC 2617, is known to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
    attacks if the client fails to authenticate the server in TLS, or if the same
    passwords are used for authentication in some other context without TLS.  This
    is a general problem that exists not just with HTTP Digest, but also with other
    IETF protocols that use tunneled authentication.  This document specifies version
    2 of the HTTP Digest AKA algorithm (RFC 3310).  This algorithm can be implemented
    in a way that it is resistant to the man-in-the-middle attack.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
