abstract:
- content: This document describes a protocol for transaction-level authentication
    using shared secrets and one-way hashing. It can be used to authenticate dynamic
    updates to a DNS zone as coming from an approved client or to authenticate responses
    as coming from an approved name server. No recommendation is made here for distributing
    the shared secrets; it is expected that a network administrator will statically
    configure name servers and clients using some out-of-band mechanism. This document
    obsoletes RFCs 2845 and 4635.
