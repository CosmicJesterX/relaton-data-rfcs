abstract:
  content: This document defines algorithms for Authenticated Encryption with Associated
    Data (AEAD), and defines a uniform interface and a registry for such algorithms.  The
    interface and registry can be used as an application-independent set of cryptoalgorithm
    suites.  This approach provides advantages in efficiency and security, and promotes
    the reuse of crypto implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
