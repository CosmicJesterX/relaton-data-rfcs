abstract:
- content: The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) provides an auxiliary logical
    data channel associated with a Label Switched Path (LSP), a pseudowire, or a section
    (link) over which a variety of protocols may flow.  These protocols are commonly
    used to provide Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms associated
    with the primary data channel.  This document specifies simple procedures by which
    an endpoint of an LSP, pseudowire, or section may inform the other endpoints of
    its capabilities and configuration parameters, or other application-specific information.  This
    information may then be used by the receiver to validate or adjust its local configuration,
    and by the network operator for diagnostic purposes.
