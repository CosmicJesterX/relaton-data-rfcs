abstract:
  content: RFCs 4761 and 4762 describe a solution for Virtual Private LAN Service
    (VPLS) multicast that relies on the use of point-to-point or multipoint-to-point
    unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for carrying multicast traffic. This solution
    has certain limitations for certain VPLS multicast traffic profiles. For example,
    it may result in highly non-optimal bandwidth utilization when a large amount
    of multicast traffic is to be transported. This document describes solutions for
    overcoming a subset of the limitations of the existing VPLS multicast solution.
    It describes procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the
    service provider (SP) network. The solution described in this document allows
    sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple VPLS instances. Furthermore,
    the solution described in this document allows a single multicast tree in the
    SP network to carry traffic belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP
    multicast streams from one or more VPLS instances.
