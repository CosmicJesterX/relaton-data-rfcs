abstract:
  content: The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between the
    metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.  The
    Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) layout type is defined in this document
    as an extension to pNFS to allow the use of SCSI-based block storage devices.
