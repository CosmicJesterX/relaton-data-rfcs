abstract:
  content: The Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) is specified in RFC 8225 to convey
    cryptographically signed information about the people involved in personal communications.
    This document extends PASSporT to include an indication that a call has been diverted
    from its original destination to a new one. This information can greatly improve
    the decisions made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios. Also
    specified here is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another
    PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios. This document
    updates RFC 8224.
