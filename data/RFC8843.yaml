abstract:
  content: This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping
    Framework extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the SDP offer/answer
    mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple) for sending and
    receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" sections).
    Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, and the media is referred
    to as bundled media. The "m=" sections that use the BUNDLE transport form a BUNDLE
    group. This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description
    (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension. This specification updates RFCs 3264,
    5888, and 7941.
