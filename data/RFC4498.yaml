abstract:
  content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB), the
    Aggregation MIB modules, for use with network management protocols in the Internet
    community.  In particular, the Aggregation MIB modules will be used to configure
    a network management agent to aggregate the values of a user-specified set of
    Managed Object instances and to service queries related to the aggregated Managed
    Object instances.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.
