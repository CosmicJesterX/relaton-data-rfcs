abstract:
  content: This document describes Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) extensions
    to bind two point-to-point unidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs) into an
    associated bidirectional LSP.  The association is achieved by defining new Association
    Types for use in ASSOCIATION and in Extended ASSOCIATION Objects.  One of these
    types enables independent provisioning of the associated bidirectional LSPs on
    both sides, while the other enables single-sided provisioning.  The REVERSE_LSP
    Object is also defined to enable a single endpoint to trigger creation of the
    reverse LSP and to specify parameters of the reverse LSP in the single-sided provisioning
    case.
