abstract:
  content: The scalability of Hierarchical Virtual Private LAN Service (H-VPLS) with
    Ethernet access networks (RFC 4762) can be improved by incorporating Provider
    Backbone Bridge functionality in the VPLS access.  Provider Backbone Bridging
    has been standardized as IEEE 802.1ah-2008.  It aims to improve the scalability
    of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet
    networks.  This document describes different interoperability scenarios where
    Provider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS
    access network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC
    addresses and number of service instances.  The document also describes the scenarios
    and the mechanisms for incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality within
    H-VPLS with existing Ethernet access and interoperability among them.  Furthermore,
    the document discusses the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which Provider
    Backbone Bridge functionality can be incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS
    access.
