abstract:
- content: 'This document describes the core concepts of the Content-Centric Networking
    (CCNx) architecture and presents a network protocol based on two messages: Interests
    and Content Objects. It specifies the set of mandatory and optional fields within
    those messages and describes their behavior and interpretation. This architecture
    and protocol specification is independent of a specific wire encoding. The protocol
    also uses a control message called an Interest Return, whereby one system can
    return an Interest message to the previous hop due to an error condition. This
    indicates to the previous hop that the current system will not respond to the
    Interest. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research
    Group (ICNRG). The document received wide review among ICNRG participants. Two
    full implementations are in active use and have informed the technical maturity
    of the protocol specification.'
