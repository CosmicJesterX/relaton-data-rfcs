abstract:
- content: This memo describes how to carry real-time text conversation session contents
    in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents are specified in ITU-T Recommendation
    T.140. One payload format is described for transmitting audio and text data within
    a single RTP session. This RTP payload description recommends a method to include
    redundant text from already transmitted packets in order to reduce the risk of
    text loss caused by packet loss. This memo defines a Historic Document for the
    Internet community.
