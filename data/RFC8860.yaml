abstract:
  content: This document specifies how an RTP session can contain RTP streams with
    media from multiple media types such as audio, video, and text.  This has been
    restricted by the RTP specifications (RFCs 3550 and 3551), and thus this document
    updates RFCs 3550 and 3551 to enable this behaviour for applications that satisfy
    the applicability for using multiple media types in a single RTP session.
