abstract:
  content: This document describes the testing result of a network utilizing a Mapping
    of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T) double translation solution; it
    provides an overview of user applications' behavior with a shared IPv4 address.
    The MAP-T software is from CERNET Center and the test environment is on the NIC.br
    network with real and virtualized machines.
