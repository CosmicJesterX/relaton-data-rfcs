abstract:
  content: This document gives an overview of the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) framework
    and protocol suite created by the NSIS Working Group during the period of 2001-2010.  It
    also includes suggestions on how the industry can make use of the new protocols
    and how the community can exploit the extensibility of both the framework and
    existing protocols to address future signaling needs.  This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
