abstract:
- content: The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication standardization
    sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872 to include a
    new Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining channel spacings,
    a set of nominal central frequencies, and the concept of the "frequency slot".
    Corresponding techniques for data-plane connections are known as "flexi-grid".
    Based on the characteristics of flexi-grid defined in G.694.1 and in RFCs 7698
    and 7699, this document describes the Open Shortest Path First - Traffic Engineering
    (OSPF-TE) extensions in support of GMPLS control of networks that include devices
    that use the new flexible optical grid.
