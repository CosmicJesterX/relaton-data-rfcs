abstract:
  content: This specification describes the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (LDAP) Content Synchronization Operation.  The operation allows a client to maintain
    a copy of a fragment of the Directory Information Tree (DIT).  It supports both
    polling for changes and listening for changes.  The operation is defined as an
    extension of the LDAP Search Operation.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
