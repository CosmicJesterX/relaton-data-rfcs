abstract:
  content: DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation allows a client to include a prefix-length hint
    value in the IA_PD option to indicate a preference for the size of the prefix
    to be delegated, but it is unclear about how the client and server should act
    in different situations involving the prefix-length hint.  This document provides
    a summary of the existing problems with the prefix-length hint and guidance on
    what the client and server could do in different situations.
