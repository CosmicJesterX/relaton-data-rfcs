abstract:
  content: Many user applications (and the transport protocols that make them possible)
    require two-way communications. To assess this capability, and to achieve test
    system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements are frequently conducted in practice.
    The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip
    loss measurement capability for the Internet. However, there is currently no round-trip
    packet loss metric specified according to the RFC 2330 framework. This memo adds
    round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
