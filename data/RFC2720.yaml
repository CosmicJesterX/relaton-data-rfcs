abstract:
  content: This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use in controlling
    an RTFM Traffic Meter, in particular for specifying the flows to be measured.  It
    also provides an efficient mechanism for retrieving flow data from the meter using
    SNMP.  Security issues concerning the operation of traffic meters are summarised.
