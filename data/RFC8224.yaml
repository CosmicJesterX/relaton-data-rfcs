abstract:
- content: The baseline security mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    are inadequate for cryptographically assuring the identity of the end users that
    originate SIP requests, especially in an interdomain context. This document defines
    a mechanism for securely identifying originators of SIP requests. It does so by
    defining a SIP header field for conveying a signature used for validating the
    identity and for conveying a reference to the credentials of the signer. This
    document obsoletes RFC 4474.
