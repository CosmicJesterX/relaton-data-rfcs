abstract:
- content: This document describes functions implemented in Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) intermediaries known as Session Border Controllers (SBCs).  The goal of
    this document is to describe the commonly provided functions of SBCs.  A special
    focus is given to those practices that are viewed to be in conflict with SIP architectural
    principles.  This document also explores the underlying requirements of network
    operators that have led to the use of these functions and practices in order to
    identify protocol requirements and determine whether those requirements are satisfied
    by existing specifications or if additional standards work is required.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
