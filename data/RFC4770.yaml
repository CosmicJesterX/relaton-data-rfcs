abstract:
- content: This document describes an extension to vCard to support Instant Messaging
    (IM) and Presence Protocol (PP) applications.  IM and PP are becoming increasingly
    common ways of communicating, and users want to save this contact information
    in their address books.  It allows a URI that is associated with IM or PP to be
    specified inside a vCard. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
