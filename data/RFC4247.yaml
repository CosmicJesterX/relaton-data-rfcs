abstract:
  content: Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP.  When
    MPLS labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  For an MPLS
    VPN, the packet header is typically 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often
    no more than 30 bytes, for example.  Header compression can significantly reduce
    the overhead through various compression mechanisms, such as enhanced compressed
    RTP (ECRTP) and robust header compression (ROHC).  We consider using MPLS to route
    compressed packets over an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) without compression/decompression
    cycles at each router.  This approach can increase the bandwidth efficiency as
    well as processing scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous flows that
    use header compression at each router.  In this document, we give a problem statement,
    goals and requirements, and an example scenario.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
