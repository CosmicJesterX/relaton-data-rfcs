abstract:
- content: DNS-SD (DNS-based Service Discovery) normally discloses information about
    devices offering and requesting services.  This information includes hostnames,
    network parameters, and possibly a further description of the corresponding service
    instance.  Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS-based Service Discovery
    at a public hotspot, serious privacy problems arise.  We analyze the requirements
    of a privacy-respecting discovery service.
