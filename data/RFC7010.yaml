abstract:
  content: This document briefly introduces the existing mechanisms that could be
    utilized for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the explicit issues
    and requirements associated with IPv6 renumbering.  The content is mainly a gap
    analysis that provides a basis for future works to identify and develop solutions
    or to stimulate such development as appropriate.  The gap analysis is organized
    by the main steps of a renumbering process.
