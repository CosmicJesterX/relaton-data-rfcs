abstract:
- content: DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on the path between
    the DNS client and its server. These queries and responses can contain privacy-sensitive
    information, which is valuable to protect. This document proposes the use of Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS, to protect against passive listeners
    and certain active attacks. As latency is critical for DNS, this proposal also
    discusses mechanisms to reduce DTLS round trips and reduce the DTLS handshake
    size. The proposed mechanism runs over port 853.
