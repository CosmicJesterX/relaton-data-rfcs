abstract:
- content: 'The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC 7049,
    is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
    code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version
    negotiation. In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
    RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as per RFC 3339)
    and tag 1 (POSIX "seconds since the epoch"). Since then, additional requirements
    have become known. This specification defines a CBOR tag for a date text string
    (as per RFC 3339) for applications needing a textual date representation within
    the Gregorian calendar without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag for days since
    the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a numeric
    date representation without a time. This specification is the reference document
    for IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.'
