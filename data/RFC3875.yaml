abstract:
  content: The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple interface for running external
    programs, software or gateways under an information server in a platform-independent
    manner. Currently, the supported information servers are HTTP servers. The interface
    has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) since 1993. This specification defines
    the 'current practice' parameters of the 'CGI/1.1' interface developed and documented
    at the U.S. National Centre for Supercomputing Applications. This document also
    defines the use of the CGI/1.1 interface on UNIX(R) and other, similar systems.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.
