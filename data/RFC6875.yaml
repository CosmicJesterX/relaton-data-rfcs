abstract:
- content: This document describes experiments that clarify how an approach similar
    to Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) was effective in reducing network
    traffic.  These experiments were performed in Japan by the P2P Network Experiment
    Council in an attempt to harmonize peer-to-peer (P2P) technology with network
    infrastructure.  Based on what was learned from these experiments, this document
    provides some suggestions that might be useful for the ALTO architecture and especially
    for application-independent ALTO- like server operation.
