abstract:
- content: This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.  In particular,
    it defines objects for managing the Ethernet Wide Area Network (WAN) Interface
    Sublayer (WIS).  The MIB module defined in this memo is an extension of the Synchronous
    Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) Interface MIB and is
    implemented in conjunction with it and with the Ethernet-like Interface MIB, the
    802.3 Medium Attachment Unit MIB, the Interfaces Group MIB, and the Inverted Stack
    Table MIB.
