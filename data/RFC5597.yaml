abstract:
  content: This document defines a set of requirements for NATs handling the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  These requirements allow DCCP applications,
    such as streaming applications, to operate consistently, and they are very similar
    to the TCP requirements for NATs, which have already been published by the IETF.  Ensuring
    that NATs meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that
    applications using DCCP will function properly.  This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.
