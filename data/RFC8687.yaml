abstract:
- content: When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 network,
    the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label Switched Path (LSP) infrastructure
    may be duplicated, even if the destination IPv4 and IPv6 addresses belong to the
    same remote router. In order to achieve an integrated MPLS TE LSP infrastructure,
    OSPF routes must be computed over MPLS TE tunnels created using information propagated
    in another OSPF instance. This issue is solved by advertising cross-address family
    (X-AF) OSPF TE information. This document describes an update to RFC 5786 that
    allows for the easy identification of a router's local X-AF IP addresses.
