abstract:
  content: Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
    want the ability to "reset" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is
    to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding
    notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed.  Applications
    requiring this feature want it so that they can "reuse" streams for different
    purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application
    can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old
    stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is
    a protocol mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero".  This document also
    includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional
    streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
