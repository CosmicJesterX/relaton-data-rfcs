abstract:
  content: This document defines Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    extensions for grouping two unidirectional MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs),
    one in each direction in the network, into an associated bidirectional LSP.  These
    PCEP extensions can be applied either using a stateful PCE for both PCE-initiated
    and PCC-initiated LSPs or using a stateless PCE.  The PCEP procedures defined
    are applicable to the LSPs using RSVP-TE for signaling.
