abstract:
  content: This document defines the requirements that individual Parallel NFS (pNFS)
    layout types need to meet in order to work within the pNFS framework as defined
    in RFC 5661.  In so doing, this document aims to clearly distinguish between requirements
    for pNFS as a whole and those specifically directed to the pNFS file layout.  The
    lack of a clear separation between the two sets of requirements has been troublesome
    for those specifying and evaluating new layout types.  In this regard, this document
    updates RFC 5661.
