abstract:
  content: This specification defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol for allowing
    a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address for each
    of its network interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple IP tunnels
    with its home agent.  This essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the
    available network interfaces and build a higher aggregated logical pipe with its
    home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these extensions also allow
    the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate IP traffic flow policies for binding
    individual flows with the registered care-of addresses.
