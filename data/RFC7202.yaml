abstract:
- content: This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia sessions.  It
    also explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the associated RTP
    Control Protocol (RTCP) do not mandate a single media security mechanism.  This
    is relevant for designers and reviewers of future RTP extensions to ensure that
    appropriate security mechanisms are mandated and that any such mechanisms are
    specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP architecture.
