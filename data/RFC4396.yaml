abstract:
- content: This document specifies an RTP payload format for the transmission of 3GPP
    (3rd Generation Partnership Project) timed text.  3GPP timed text is a time-lined,
    decorated text media format with defined storage in a 3GP file.  Timed Text can
    be synchronized with audio/video contents and used in applications such as captioning,
    titling, and multimedia presentations.  In the following sections, the problems
    of streaming timed text are addressed, and a payload format for streaming 3GPP
    timed text over RTP is specified. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
