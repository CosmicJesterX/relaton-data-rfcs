abstract:
- content: This document describes the method used to derive initial MPPE session
    keys from a variety of credential types.  It is expected that this memo will be
    updated whenever Microsoft defines a new key derivation method for MPPE, since
    its primary purpose is to provide an open, easily accessible reference for third-parties
    wishing to interoperate with Microsoft products.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
