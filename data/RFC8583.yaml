abstract:
- content: RFC 7068 describes requirements for Overload Control in Diameter.  This
    includes a requirement to allow Diameter nodes to send "load" information, even
    when the node is not overloaded.  The base solution defined in RFC 7683 (Diameter
    Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC)) describes a mechanism meeting most of
    the requirements but does not currently include the ability to send load information.  This
    document defines a mechanism for the conveying of Diameter load information.
