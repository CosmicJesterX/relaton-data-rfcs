abstract:
  content: This document describes a set of private header (P-header) Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) fields used by the 3GPP, along with their applicability, which
    is limited to particular environments.  The P-header fields are used for a variety
    of purposes within the networks that the partners implement, including charging
    and information about the networks a call traverses.  This document obsoletes
    RFC 3455.
