abstract:
- content: 'This memo extends the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES)
    model defined in RFC 5812 and updates that RFC to allow complex data types for
    metadata, optional default values for data types, and optional access types for
    structures.  It also fixes an issue with Logical Functional Block (LFB) inheritance
    and introduces two new features: a new event condition called eventBecomesEqualTo
    and LFB properties.  The changes introduced in this memo do not alter the protocol
    and retain backward compatibility with older LFB models.'
