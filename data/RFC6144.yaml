abstract:
  content: This note describes a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation.  This is in
    the context of replacing Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-PT),
    which was deprecated by RFC 4966, and to enable networks to have IPv4 and IPv6
    coexist in a somewhat rational manner while transitioning to an IPv6 network.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
