abstract:
  content: This document presents the Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP).  TRIP is a
    policy driven inter-administrative domain protocol for advertising the reachability
    of telephony destinations between location servers, and for advertising attributes
    of the routes to those destinations.  TRIP's operation is independent of any signaling
    protocol, hence TRIP can serve as the telephony routing protocol for any signaling
    protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
