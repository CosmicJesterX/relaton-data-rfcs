abstract:
  content: When Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is used for remote
    VPN access (client to VPN gateway), the gateway assigns the client an IP address
    from the internal network using IKEv2 configuration payloads.  The configuration
    payloads specified in RFC 4306 work well for IPv4 but make it difficult to use
    certain features of IPv6.  This document specifies new configuration attributes
    for IKEv2 that allows the VPN gateway to assign IPv6 prefixes to clients, enabling
    all features of IPv6 to be used with the client-gateway "virtual link".  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
