abstract:
- content: 'This document presents a retrieval method YANG data model for connectionless
    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols.  It provides technology-independent
    RPC operations for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication.  The retrieval
    methods model herein presented can be extended to include technology- specific
    details.  There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity
    between OAM protocols.  Second, it supports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing
    OAM functions at different or the same levels through a unified interface) as
    well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same
    levels through a unified interface).'
