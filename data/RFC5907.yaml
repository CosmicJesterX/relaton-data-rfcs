abstract:
  content: The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and sizes
    for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other networked equipment.  As
    time synchronization is more and more a mission-critical service, standardized
    means for monitoring and management of this subsystem of a networked host are
    required to allow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring system that
    is platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a standardized collection
    of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity of such a network participant and
    it is part of the NTP version 4 standardization effort. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
