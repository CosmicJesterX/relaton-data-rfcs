abstract:
  content: The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real- time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) in order to provide a variety of short- term and long-term
    reception statistics.  The available reporting may include aggregate information
    across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.  This document
    specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets discarded from
    the de- jitter buffer after successful reception.
