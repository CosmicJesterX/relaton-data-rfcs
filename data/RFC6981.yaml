abstract:
- content: This document presents an illustrative framework for providing fast reroute
    in an IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding to "not-via" addresses.
    The general approach described here uses a single level of encapsulation and could
    be used to protect unicast, multicast, and LDP traffic against link, router, and
    shared risk group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics. The mechanisms
    presented in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and
    do not constitute a protocol specification. The document represents a snapshot
    of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is
    published as a document of record. Further work is needed before implementation
    or deployment.
