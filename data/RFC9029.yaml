abstract:
  content: RFC 7752 defines the Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS). IANA
    created a registry consistent with that document called "Border Gateway Protocol
    - Link State (BGP-LS) Parameters" with a number of subregistries. The allocation
    policy applied by IANA for those registries is "Specification Required", as defined
    in RFC 8126. This document updates RFC 7752 by changing the allocation policy
    for all of the registries to "Expert Review" and by updating the guidance to the
    designated experts.
