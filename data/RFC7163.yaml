abstract:
- content: This document updates the registration guidance provided in Section 4.2
    of RFC 5031, which allows the registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service
    type only for emergency services "that are offered widely and in different countries".  This
    document updates those instructions to allow such registrations when, at the time
    of registration, those services are offered in only one country.
