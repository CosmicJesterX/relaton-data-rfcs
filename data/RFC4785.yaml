abstract:
  content: This document specifies authentication-only ciphersuites (with no encryption)
    for the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  These
    ciphersuites are useful when authentication and integrity protection is desired,
    but confidentiality is not needed or not permitted. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
