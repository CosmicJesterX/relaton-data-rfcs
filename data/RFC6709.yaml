abstract:
  content: This document discusses architectural issues related to the extensibility
    of Internet protocols, with a focus on design considerations.  It is intended
    to assist designers of both base protocols and extensions.  Case studies are included.  A
    companion document, RFC 4775 (BCP 125), discusses procedures relating to the extensibility
    of IETF protocols.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
