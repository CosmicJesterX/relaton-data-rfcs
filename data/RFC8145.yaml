abstract:
- content: The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication
    and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital
    signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust
    anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies
    two different ways for validating resolvers to signal to a server which keys are
    referenced in their chain of trust.  The data from such signaling allow zone administrators
    to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC-signed zone.
