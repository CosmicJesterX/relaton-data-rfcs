abstract:
- content: Experience in implementing and deploying the Forwarding and Control Element
    Separation (ForCES) architecture has demonstrated the need for a few small extensions
    both to ease programmability and to improve wire efficiency of some transactions.  The
    ForCES protocol is extended with a table range operation and a new extension for
    error handling.  This document updates the semantics in RFCs 5810 and 7121 to
    achieve that end goal.
