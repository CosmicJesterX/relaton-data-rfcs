abstract:
  content: This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT). The workshop
    was hosted by the University of Cambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge,
    UK. The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols,
    through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular emphasis
    at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the protocol stack). This report
    summarizes contributions and discussions. As the topics were wide ranging, there
    is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time.
    Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted areas that
    deserve further exploration. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings
    of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of
    the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.
