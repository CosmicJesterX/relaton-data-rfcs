abstract:
  content: This document describes the encoding used in electronic mail [RFC822] and
    network news [RFC1036] messages over the Internet.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.  Telecommunications infrastructure is improving to offer higher bandwidth
    connections at lower cost.  Access to the network is changing from modems to more
    intelligent devices.  This informational RFC discusses a PPP Network Control Protocol
    for one such intelligent device.  The protocol is the LAN extension interface
    protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
    does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
