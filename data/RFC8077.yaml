abstract:
  content: Layer 2 services (such as Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode, and
    Ethernet) can be emulated over an MPLS backbone by encapsulating the Layer 2 Protocol
    Data Units (PDUs) and then transmitting them over pseudowires (PWs). It is also
    possible to use pseudowires to provide low-rate Time-Division Multiplexed and
    Synchronous Optical NETworking circuit emulation over an MPLS-enabled network.
    This document specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the pseudowires,
    using extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). Procedures for encapsulating
    Layer 2 PDUs are specified in other documents. This document is a rewrite of RFC
    4447 for publication as an Internet Standard.
