abstract:
  content: The purpose of this informational document is to establish test and evaluation
    methodology and measurement techniques for physical network equipment in the data
    center.  RFC 8238 is a prerequisite for this document, as it contains terminology
    that is considered normative.  Many of these terms and methods may be applicable
    beyond the scope of this document as the technologies originally applied in the
    data center are deployed elsewhere.
