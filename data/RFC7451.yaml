abstract:
  content: The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes features to add functionality
    by extending the protocol.  It does not, however, describe how those extensions
    are managed.  This document describes a procedure for the registration and management
    of extensions to EPP, and it specifies a format for an IANA registry to record
    those extensions.
