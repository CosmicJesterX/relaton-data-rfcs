abstract:
  content: This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of systems
    to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic between them. It then
    expands on the requirements for such a solution. Manual configuration of all possible
    tunnels is too cumbersome in many such cases. In other cases, the IP addresses
    of endpoints change, or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways, making static
    configuration impossible. The Auto-Discovery VPN solution will address these requirements.
