abstract:
- content: This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general "LOCATOR" parameter
    for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses
    at which it may be reached.  This document also defines elements of procedure
    for mobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes
    the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same LOCATOR parameter
    can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures are left
    for further study.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.
