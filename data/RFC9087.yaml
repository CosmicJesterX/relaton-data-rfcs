abstract:
- content: Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing. A node steers a packet through
    a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with
    an SR header. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service
    based. SR allows for the enforcement of a flow through any topological path while
    maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain. The Segment
    Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS data plane with no change
    on the forwarding plane. It requires a minor extension to the existing link-state
    routing protocols. This document illustrates the application of Segment Routing
    to solve the BGP Egress Peer Engineering (BGP-EPE) requirement. The SR-based BGP-EPE
    solution allows a centralized (Software-Defined Networking, or SDN) controller
    to program any egress peer policy at ingress border routers or at hosts within
    the domain.
