abstract:
  content: This document specifies the export of packet information from a Packet
    SAMPling (PSAMP) Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collecting Process.  For export
    of packet information, the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol is used,
    as both the IPFIX and PSAMP architecture match very well, and the means provided
    by the IPFIX protocol are sufficient.  The document specifies in detail how the
    IPFIX protocol is used for PSAMP export of packet information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
