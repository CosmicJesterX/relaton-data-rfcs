abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting IPv4/IPv6
    and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets over InfiniBand (IB).  It describes
    the link-layer address to be used when resolving the IP addresses in IP over InfiniBand
    (IPoIB) subnets.  The document also describes the mapping from IP multicast addresses
    to InfiniBand multicast addresses.  In addition, this document defines the setup
    and configuration of IPoIB links. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
