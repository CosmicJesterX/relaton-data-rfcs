abstract:
  content: 'Various applications of MPLS make use of label stacks with multiple entries.  In
    some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of the stack with an IP-based
    encapsulation, thereby enabling the application to run over networks that do not
    have MPLS enabled in their core routers.  This document specifies two IP-based
    encapsulations: MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).  Each
    of these is applicable in some circumstances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
