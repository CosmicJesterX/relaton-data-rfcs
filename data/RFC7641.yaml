abstract:
  content: The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a RESTful application protocol
    for constrained nodes and networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server
    can change over time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for
    CoAP that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve a representation
    of a resource and keep this representation updated by the server over a period
    of time.  The protocol follows a best-effort approach for sending new representations
    to clients and provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each
    client and the actual resource state at the server.
