abstract:
  content: 'The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
    provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. The present
    document defines a number of control operators that were not yet ready at the
    time RFC 8610 was completed: , , and for the construction of constants; / for
    including ABNF (RFC 5234 and RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications; and for indicating
    the use of a non-basic feature in an instance.'
