abstract:
- content: This document discusses issues with the specific form of IPv6-IPv4 protocol
    translation mechanism implemented by the Network Address Translator - Protocol
    Translator (NAT-PT) defined in RFC 2766.  These issues are sufficiently serious
    that recommending RFC 2766 as a general purpose transition mechanism is no longer
    desirable, and this document recommends that the IETF should reclassify RFC 2766
    from Proposed Standard to Historic status.  This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.
