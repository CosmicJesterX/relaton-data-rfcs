abstract:
  content: The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes a client authentication
    scheme that is based on a user identifier and password.  The structure of the
    password field is defined by an XML Schema data type that specifies minimum and
    maximum password length values, but there are no other provisions for password
    management other than changing the password.  This document describes an EPP extension
    that allows longer passwords to be created and adds additional security features
    to the EPP login command and response.
