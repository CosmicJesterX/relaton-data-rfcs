abstract:
- content: The IETF has produced many modules in the YANG modeling language. The majority
    of these modules are used to construct data models to model devices or monolithic
    functions. A small number of YANG modules have been defined to model services
    (for example, the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service Model (L3SM) produced
    by the L3SM working group and documented in RFC 8049). This document describes
    service models as used within the IETF and also shows where a service model might
    fit into a software-defined networking architecture. Note that service models
    do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered and delivered
    for a customer; details of how network protocols and devices are engineered to
    deliver a service are captured in other modules that are not exposed through the
    interface between the customer and the provider.
