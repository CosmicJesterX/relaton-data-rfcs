abstract:
- content: This document is a companion to the ION working group's architecture document,
    "IPv6 over Non Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks".  It provides specific
    details on how to apply the IPv6 over NBMA architecture to ATM networks.  This
    architecture allows conventional host-side operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    protocol, while also supporting the establishment of 'shortcut' ATM forwarding
    paths (when using SVCs).  Operation over administratively configured Point to
    Point PVCs is also supported. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
