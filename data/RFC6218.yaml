abstract:
- content: This document defines a set of vendor-specific RADIUS Attributes designed
    to allow both the secure transmission of cryptographic keying material and strong
    authentication of any RADIUS message.  These attributes have been allocated from
    the Cisco vendor-specific space and have been implemented by multiple vendors.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
