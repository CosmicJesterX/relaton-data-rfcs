abstract:
  content: This memo describes a new key exchange method for the Secure Shell (SSH)
    protocol.  It allows the SSH server to propose new groups on which to perform
    the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to the client.  The proposed groups need not be
    fixed and can change with time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
