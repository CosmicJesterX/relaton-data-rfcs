abstract:
- content: The IETF is engaged in an effort to analyze the security of routing protocol
    authentication according to design guidelines discussed in RFC 6518, "Keying and
    Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines".  Developing an
    operational and management model for routing protocol security that works with
    all the routing protocols will be critical to the deployability of these efforts.  This
    document gives recommendations to operators and implementors regarding management
    and operation of router authentication.  These recommendations will also assist
    protocol designers in understanding management issues they will face.
