abstract:
  content: This document is an analysis of multihoming in the context of network mobility
    (NEMO) in IPv6.  As there are many situations in which mobile networks may be
    multihomed, a taxonomy is proposed to classify the possible configurations.  The
    possible deployment scenarios of multihomed mobile networks are described together
    with the associated issues when network mobility is supported by RFC 3963 (NEMO
    Basic Support).  Recommendations are offered on how to address these issues.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
