abstract:
  content: The MediaCtrl working group in the IETF has proposed an architecture for
    controlling media services.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used as
    the signaling protocol that provides many inherent capabilities for message routing.  In
    addition to such signaling properties, a need exists for intelligent, application-level
    media service selection based on non-static signaling properties.  This is especially
    true when considered in conjunction with deployment architectures that include
    1:M and M:N combinations of Application Servers and Media Servers.  This document
    introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) entity, which manages the availability
    of Media Servers and the media resource demands of Application Servers.  The document
    includes potential deployment options for an MRB and appropriate interfaces to
    Application Servers and Media Servers.
