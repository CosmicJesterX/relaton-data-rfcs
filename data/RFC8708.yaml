abstract:
- content: This document specifies the conventions for using the Hierarchical Signature
    System (HSS) / Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) hash-based signature algorithm
    with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  In addition, the algorithm identifier
    and public key syntax are provided.  The HSS/LMS algorithm is one form of hash-based
    digital signature; it is described in RFC 8554.
