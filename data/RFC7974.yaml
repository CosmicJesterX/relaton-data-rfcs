abstract:
- content: Recent RFCs have discussed issues with host identification in IP address-sharing
    systems, such as address/prefix-sharing devices and application-layer proxies.  Potential
    solutions for revealing a host identifier in shared address deployments have also
    been discussed.  This memo describes the design, deployment, and privacy considerations
    for one such solution in operational use on the Internet today that uses a TCP
    option to transmit a host identifier.
