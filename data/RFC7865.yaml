abstract:
  content: Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications environments,
    such as call centers and financial trading organizations.  In some of these environments,
    all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer protection
    reasons.  The recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy
    of a media stream to a recording device.  This document describes the metadata
    model as viewed by the Session Recording Server (SRS) and the recording metadata
    format.
