abstract:
  content: This memo updates the definition of the Sieve mail filtering language "reject"
    extension, originally defined in RFC 3028. A "Joe-job" is a spam run forged to
    appear as though it came from an innocent party, who is then generally flooded
    by automated bounces, Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs), and personal messages
    with complaints. The original Sieve "reject" action defined in RFC 3028 required
    use of MDNs for rejecting messages, thus contributing to the flood of Joe-job
    spam to victims of Joe-jobs. This memo updates the definition of the "reject"
    action to allow messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, and defines
    the "ereject" action to require messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction,
    if possible. The "ereject" action is intended to replace the "reject" action wherever
    possible. The "ereject" action is similar to "reject", but will always favor protocol-level
    message rejection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
