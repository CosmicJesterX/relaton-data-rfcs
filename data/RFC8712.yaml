abstract:
  content: This document summarizes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - Internet
    Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to the structure of the
    IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in 2018.  The IASA was revised under
    a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the IASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's
    administrative, legal, and financial structure.  As a result, it also changed
    the relationship between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to revise
    RFC 2031.
