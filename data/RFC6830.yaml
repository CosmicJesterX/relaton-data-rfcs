abstract:
- content: 'This document describes a network-layer-based protocol that enables separation
    of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and
    Routing Locators (RLOCs). No changes are required to either host protocol stacks
    or to the "core" of the Internet infrastructure. The Locator/ID Separation Protocol
    (LISP) can be incrementally deployed, without a "flag day", and offers Traffic
    Engineering, multihoming, and mobility benefits to early adopters, even when there
    are relatively few LISP-capable sites. Design and development of LISP was largely
    motivated by the problem statement produced by the October 2006 IAB Routing and
    Addressing Workshop. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.'
