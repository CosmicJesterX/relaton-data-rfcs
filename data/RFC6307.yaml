abstract:
  content: A Fibre Channel pseudowire (PW) is used to carry Fibre Channel traffic
    over an MPLS network.  This enables service providers to take advantage of MPLS
    to offer "emulated" Fibre Channel services.  This document specifies the encapsulation
    of Fibre Channel traffic within a pseudowire.  It also specifies the common procedures
    for using a PW to provide a Fibre Channel service. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
