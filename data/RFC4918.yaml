abstract:
  content: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of
    methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of
    resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace
    manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance). RFC 2518 was published
    in February 1999, and this specification obsoletes RFC 2518 with minor revisions
    mostly due to interoperability experience. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
