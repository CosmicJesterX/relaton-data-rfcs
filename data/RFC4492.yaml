abstract:
- content: This document describes new key exchange algorithms based on Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography (ECC) for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  In particular,
    it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in
    a TLS handshake and the use of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
    as a new authentication mechanism.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
