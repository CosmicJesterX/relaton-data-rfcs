abstract:
- content: The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol that can
    be used in a wide range of applications, networks, and system topologies.  That
    flexibility makes for wide applicability but can complicate the application design
    process.  One particular design question that has received much attention is how
    to support multiple media streams in RTP.  This memo discusses the available options
    and design trade-offs, and provides guidelines on how to use the multiplexing
    features of RTP to support multiple media streams.
