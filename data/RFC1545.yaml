abstract:
- content: This RFC specifies a method for assigning long addresses in the HOST- PORT
    specification for the data port to be used in establishing a data connection for
    File Transfer Protocol, FTP (STD 9, RFC 959).  This is a general solution, applicable
    for all "next generation" IP alternatives, and can also be extended to allow FTP
    operation over transport interfaces other than TCP.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard
    of any kind.
