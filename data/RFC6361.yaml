- content: The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) defines a Link Control Protocol (LCP)
    and a method for negotiating the use of multiprotocol traffic over point-to-point
    links.  This document describes PPP support for the Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links (TRILL) Protocol, allowing direct communication between Routing
    Bridges (RBridges) via PPP links. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
