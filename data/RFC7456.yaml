abstract:
- content: Performance Monitoring (PM) is a key aspect of Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM).  It allows network operators to verify the Service Level
    Agreement (SLA) provided to customers and to detect network anomalies.  This document
    specifies mechanisms for Loss Measurement and Delay Measurement in Transparent
    Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) networks.
