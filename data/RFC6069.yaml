abstract:
  content: Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity, which last longer than one
    retransmission timeout, cause suboptimal TCP performance. The reason for this
    performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment loss induced by long connectivity
    disruptions as a sign of congestion, resulting in repeated retransmission timer
    backoffs. This, in turn, leads to a delayed detection of the re-establishment
    of the connection since TCP waits for the next retransmission timeout before it
    attempts a retransmission. This document proposes an algorithm to make TCP more
    robust to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD). It describes how standard ICMP
    messages can be exploited during timeout-based loss recovery to disambiguate true
    congestion loss from non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions. Moreover,
    a reversion strategy of the retransmission timer is specified that enables a more
    prompt detection of whether or not the connectivity to a previously disconnected
    peer node has been restored. TCP-LCD is a TCP sender- only modification that effectively
    improves TCP performance in the case of connectivity disruptions. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
