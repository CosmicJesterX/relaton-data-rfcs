abstract:
- content: This document provides context and a report on the workshop on "Root Causes
    and Mitigation of Name Collisions", which took place in London, United Kingdom,
    from March 8 to 10, 2014.  The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion
    on the causes and potential mitigations of domain name collisions.  This report
    provides a small amount of background and context; then, it provides a summary
    of the workshop's discussions.
