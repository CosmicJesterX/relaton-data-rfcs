abstract:
  content: This document provides implementation guidelines for the use of return
    codes in RFC 3435, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Version 1.0.  Return
    codes in RFC 3435 do not cover all possible specific situations that may ever
    occur in a gateway.  That is not possible and not necessary.  What is important
    is to ensure that the Call Agent that receives a return code behaves appropriately
    and consistently for the given situation.  The purpose of this document is to
    provide implementation guidelines to ensure that consistency.
