abstract:
  content: This document describes the Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK)
    proof, a non-interactive variant of the three-pass Schnorr identification scheme.  The
    Schnorr NIZK proof allows one to prove the knowledge of a discrete logarithm without
    leaking any information about its value.  It can serve as a useful building block
    for many cryptographic protocols to ensure that participants follow the protocol
    specification honestly.  This document specifies the Schnorr NIZK proof in both
    the finite field and the elliptic curve settings.
