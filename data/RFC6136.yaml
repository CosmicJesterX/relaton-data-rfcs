abstract:
- content: This document provides framework and requirements for Layer 2 Virtual Private
    Network (L2VPN) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  The OAM framework
    is intended to provide OAM layering across L2VPN services, pseudowires (PWs),
    and Packet Switched Network (PSN) tunnels.  This document is intended to identify
    OAM requirements for L2VPN services, i.e., Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS),
    Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), and IP-only LAN Service (IPLS).  Furthermore,
    if L2VPN service OAM requirements impose specific requirements on PW OAM and/or
    PSN OAM, those specific PW and/or PSN OAM requirements are also identified.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
