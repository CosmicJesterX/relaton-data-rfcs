abstract:
  content: Ever since Gutenberg discovered and patented ASCII and the corresponding
    "Courier New" font with its now-famous "ten" point size, artisans and artificers
    have striven to represent their views of the world in print. Similarly, starting
    from Darwin's discovery of the hippogriff and his subsequent registration of the
    creature as an International Trade Mark, men (and some women) have struggled to
    catalog the fabulous variety that is called "nature". This document supplies a
    number of representations of all manner of things (both elemental and hypothetical)
    supplied by some of our best collectors of curios and delivered in a manner that
    may well be reused by the cunning document author.
