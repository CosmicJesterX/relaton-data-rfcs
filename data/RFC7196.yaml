abstract:
- content: Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in routers.  Unfortunately,
    RFD was found to severely penalize sites for being well connected because topological
    richness amplifies the number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have
    turned RFD off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends adjusting
    a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits in order to reduce the high risks with
    RFD.  The result is damping a non-trivial amount of long-term churn without penalizing
    well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence process.
