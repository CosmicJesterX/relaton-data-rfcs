abstract:
- content: Integrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC) with IPsec (ROHCoIPsec) offers
    the combined benefits of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization.  However,
    in order to integrate ROHC with IPsec, extensions to the Security Policy Database
    (SPD) and Security Association Database (SAD) are required.  This document describes
    the IPsec extensions required to support ROHCoIPsec. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
