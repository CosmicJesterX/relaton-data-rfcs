abstract:
  content: This document defines a list of operational security requirements for the
    infrastructure of large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP networks (routers and
    switches).  A framework is defined for specifying "profiles", which are collections
    of requirements applicable to certain network topology contexts (all, core-only,
    edge-only...).  The goal is to provide network operators a clear, concise way
    of communicating their security requirements to vendors.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
