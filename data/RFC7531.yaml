abstract:
  content: The Network File System (NFS) version 4 protocol is a distributed file
    system protocol that owes its heritage to NFS protocol version 2 (RFC 1094) and
    version 3 (RFC 1813). Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports
    traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and the MOUNT
    protocol. In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), COMPOUND
    operations, client caching, and internationalization has been added. Of course,
    attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet
    environment. RFC 7530 formally obsoletes RFC 3530. This document, together with
    RFC 7530, replaces RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.
