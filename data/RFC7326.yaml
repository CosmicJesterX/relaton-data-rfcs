abstract:
  content: This document defines a framework for Energy Management (EMAN) for devices
    and device components within, or connected to, communication networks.  The framework
    presents a physical reference model and information model.  The information model
    consists of an Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects.  Each Energy
    Object can be attributed with identity, classification, and context.  Energy Objects
    can be monitored and controlled with respect to power, Power State, energy, demand,
    Power Attributes, and battery.  Additionally, the framework models relationships
    and capabilities between Energy Objects.
