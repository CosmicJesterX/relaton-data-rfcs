abstract:
- content: This document is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (LDAP) technical specification.  It provides a technical specification of attribute
    types and object classes intended for use by LDAP directory clients for many directory
    services, such as White Pages.  These objects are widely used as a basis for the
    schema in many LDAP directories.  This document does not cover attributes used
    for the administration of directory servers, nor does it include directory objects
    defined for specific uses in other documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
