abstract:
- content: This RFC specifies a method for assigning addresses other than 32-bit IPv4
    addresses to data ports through the specification of a "long Port (LPRT)" command
    and "Long Passive (LPSV)" reply, each having as its argument a <long-host-port>,
    which allows for additional address families, variable length network addresses
    and variable length port numbers.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
