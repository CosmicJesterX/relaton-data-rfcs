abstract:
- content: This document describes how Service Function Chaining (SFC) can be achieved
    in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the Network Service
    Header (NSH) in an MPLS label stack.  That is, the NSH is not used, but the fields
    of the NSH are mapped to fields in the MPLS label stack.  This approach does not
    deprecate or replace the NSH, but it acknowledges that there may be a need for
    an interim deployment of SFC functionality in brownfield networks.
