abstract:
- content: The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose
    design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small
    message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.  These
    design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1
    and MessagePack.
