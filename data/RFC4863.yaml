abstract:
- content: Pseudowire signaling requires that the Pseudowire Type (PW Type) be identical
    in both directions.  For certain applications the configuration of the PW Type
    is most easily accomplished by configuring this information at just one PW endpoint.  In
    any form of LDP-based signaling, each PW endpoint must initiate the creation of
    a unidirectional LSP.  In order to allow the initiation of these two LSPs to remain
    independent, a means is needed for allowing the PW endpoint (lacking a priori
    knowledge of the PW Type) to initiate the creation of an LSP.  This document defines
    a Wildcard PW Type to satisfy this need. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
