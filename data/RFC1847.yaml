abstract:
  content: This document defines a framework within which security services may be
    applied to MIME body parts. [STANDARDS-TRACK] This memo defines a new Simple Mail
    Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [1] reply code, 521, which one may use to indicate that
    an Internet host does not accept incoming mail.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.  This memo defines an extension to the SMTP
    service whereby an interrupted SMTP transaction can be restarted at a later time
    without having to repeat all of the commands and message content sent prior to
    the interruption.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.
