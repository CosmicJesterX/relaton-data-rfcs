abstract:
  content: This specification defines a profile for the use of X.509 Attribute Certificates
    in Internet Protocols.  Attribute certificates may be used in a wide range of
    applications and environments covering a broad spectrum of interoperability goals
    and a broader spectrum of operational and assurance requirements.  The goal of
    this document is to establish a common baseline for generic applications requiring
    broad interoperability as well as limited special purpose requirements.  The profile
    places emphasis on attribute certificate support for Internet electronic mail,
    IPsec, and WWW security applications.  This document obsoletes RFC 3281. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
