abstract:
  content: This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service, which allows an SMTP
    client to specify (a) that delivery status notifications (DSNs) should be generated
    under certain conditions, (b) whether such notifications should return the contents
    of the message, and (c) additional information, to be returned with a DSN, that
    allows the sender to identify both the recipient(s) for which the DSN was issued,
    and the transaction in which the original message was sent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
