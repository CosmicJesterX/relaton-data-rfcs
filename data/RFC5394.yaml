abstract:
  content: The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture introduces the concept
    of policy in the context of path computation.  This document provides additional
    details on policy within the PCE architecture and also provides context for the
    support of PCE Policy.  This document introduces the use of the Policy Core Information
    Model (PCIM) as a framework for supporting path computation policy.  This document
    also provides representative scenarios for the support of PCE Policy.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
