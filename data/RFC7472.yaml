abstract:
  content: This document defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS transport
    binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, which is used to designate the
    access to the network location of a secure IPP print service or a network resource
    managed by such a service. This document defines an alternate IPP transport binding
    to that defined in the original IPP URL Scheme (RFC 3510), but this document does
    not update or obsolete RFC 3510.
