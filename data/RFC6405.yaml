  content: This document depicts many common Voice over IP (VoIP) use cases for Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) peering.  These use cases are categorized into static
    and on-demand, and then further sub- categorized into direct and indirect.  These

    today.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
