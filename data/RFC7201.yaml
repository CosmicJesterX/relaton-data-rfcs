abstract:
- content: The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of different
    application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity implies that different
    security mechanisms are needed to provide services such as confidentiality, integrity,
    and source authentication of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets suitable
    for the various environments.  The range of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based
    application developers to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This document provides
    an overview of a number of security solutions for RTP and gives guidance for developers
    on how to choose the appropriate security mechanism.
