abstract:
  content: A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface for
    communication. Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static configuration and
    does not consider the path characteristics, which may affect the user experience.
    This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to measure the path characteristics
    fractional loss and RTT using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) messages.
