abstract:
- content: The DNAME record provides redirection for a subtree of the domain name
    tree in the DNS.  That is, all names that end with a particular suffix are redirected
    to another part of the DNS.  This document obsoletes the original specification
    in RFC 2672 as well as updates the document on representing IPv6 addresses in
    DNS (RFC 3363). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
