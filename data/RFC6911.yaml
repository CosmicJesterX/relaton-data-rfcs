abstract:
- content: This document specifies additional IPv6 RADIUS Attributes useful in residential
    broadband network deployments.  The Attributes, which are used for authorization
    and accounting, enable assignment of a host IPv6 address and an IPv6 DNS server
    address via DHCPv6, assignment of an IPv6 route announced via router advertisement,
    assignment of a named IPv6 delegated prefix pool, and assignment of a named IPv6
    pool for host DHCPv6 addressing.
