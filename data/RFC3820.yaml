abstract:
  content: This document forms a certificate profile for Proxy Certificates, based
    on X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates as defined in RFC 3280,
    for use in the Internet.  The term Proxy Certificate is used to describe a certificate
    that is derived from, and signed by, a normal X.509 Public Key End Entity Certificate
    or by another Proxy Certificate for the purpose of providing restricted proxying
    and delegation within a PKI based authentication system. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
