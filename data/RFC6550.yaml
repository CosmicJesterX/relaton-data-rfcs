abstract:
  content: Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both
    the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate
    with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their
    interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs
    are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported
    traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint
    (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point
    (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document
    specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which
    provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the
    LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from
    the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support
    for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
