abstract:
  content: This memo describes the experiences of a project team at Cray Research,
    Inc., in implementing support for circuit-switched T3 services.  While the issues
    discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems of the Internet,
    they may be interesting to a number of researchers and implementers.  This RFC
    provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet
    standard.
