abstract:
- content: The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery's Router Advertisement message contains an
    8-bit field reserved for single-bit flags.  Several protocols have reserved flags
    in this field and others are preparing to reserve a sufficient number of flags
    to exhaust the field.  This document defines an option to the Router Advertisement
    message that expands the number of flag bits available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
