abstract:
- content: 'Pervasive monitoring attacks on the privacy of Internet users are of serious
    concern to both user and operator communities.  RFC 7258 discusses the critical
    need to protect users'' privacy when developing IETF specifications and also recognizes
    that making networks unmanageable to mitigate pervasive monitoring is not an acceptable
    outcome: an appropriate balance is needed.  This document discusses current security
    and network operations as well as management practices that may be impacted by
    the shift to increased use of encryption to help guide protocol development in
    support of manageable and secure networks.'
