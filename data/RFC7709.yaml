abstract:
  content: Establishment and control of Label Switch Paths (LSPs) have become mainstream
    tools of commercial and government network providers. One of the elements of further
    evolving such networks is scaling their performance in terms of LSP bandwidth
    and traffic loads, LSP intensity (e.g., rate of LSP creation, deletion, and modification),
    LSP set up delay, quality-of-service differentiation, and different levels of
    resilience. The goal of this document is to present target scaling objectives
    and the related protocol requirements for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS).
