abstract:
  content: This document specifies the procedures for interoperation between Multicast
    Virtual Private Network (MVPN) Source-Active (SA) routes and customer Multicast
    Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) SA routes, which is useful for MVPN provider
    networks offering services to customers with an existing MSDP infrastructure.  Without
    the procedures described in this document, VPN-specific MSDP sessions are required
    among the Provider Edge (PE) routers that are customer MSDP peers.  This document
    updates RFC 6514.
