abstract:
- content: A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and IPsec
    security associations with its Home Agent before it can start utilizing Mobile
    IPv6 service.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these are statically configured.  This
    document defines how a Mobile IPv6 node can bootstrap this information from non-topological
    information and security credentials pre-configured on the Mobile Node.  The solution
    defined in this document solves the split scenario described in the Mobile IPv6
    bootstrapping problem statement in RFC 4640.  The split scenario refers to the
    case where the Mobile Node's mobility service is authorized by a different service
    provider than basic network access.  The solution described in this document is
    also generically applicable to any bootstrapping case, since other scenarios are
    more specific realizations of the split scenario. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
