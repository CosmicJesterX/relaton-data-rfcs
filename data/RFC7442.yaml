abstract:
  content: 'When IP multicast trees created by Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
    Mode (PIM-SM) in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) mode need to pass through an MPLS
    domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched
    Paths (P2MP LSPs).  This document describes how to accomplish this in the case
    where such P2MP LSPs are established using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Extensions
    for P2MP and Multipoint-to-Multipoint LSPs: Multipoint LDP (mLDP).'
