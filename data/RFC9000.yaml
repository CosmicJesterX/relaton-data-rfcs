abstract:
- content: This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC provides
    applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication, low-latency
    connection establishment, and network path migration.  QUIC includes security
    measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of
    deployment circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the integration of
    TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control algorithm.
