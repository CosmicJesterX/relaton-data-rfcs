abstract:
  content: The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed to return matching records efficiently
    for queries for data that are relatively static.  When those records change frequently,
    DNS is still efficient at returning the updated results when polled, as long as
    the polling rate is not too high.  But, there exists no mechanism for a client
    to be asynchronously notified when these changes occur.  This document defines
    a mechanism for a client to be notified of such changes to DNS records, called
    DNS Push Notifications.
