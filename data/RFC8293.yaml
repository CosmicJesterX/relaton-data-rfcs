abstract:
  content: This document provides a framework for supporting multicast traffic in
    a network that uses Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3).  Both infrastructure
    multicast and application-specific multicast are discussed.  It describes the
    various mechanisms that can be used for delivering such traffic as well as the
    data plane and control plane considerations for each of the mechanisms.
