abstract:
  content: This document presents the author's effort to understand the delays involved
    in publishing an idea in the IETF or through the Independent Stream, from the
    first individual draft to the publication of the RFC. We analyze a set of randomly
    chosen RFCs approved in 2018, looking for history and delays. We also use two
    randomly chosen sets of RFCs published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing delays seen
    in 2018 to those observed 10 or 20 years ago. The average RFC in the 2018 sample
    was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent
    in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3
    to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation in RFC production delays comes
    from the AUTH48 phase. We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC
    using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about deployment.
    We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but correlate only loosely
    with deployment or usage of the specifications. Counting web references could
    complement that.
