abstract:
- content: 'This document defines the problem statement, scope, and protocol requirements
    between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) reference model.  NEA
    provides owners of networks (e.g., an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism
    to evaluate the posture of a system.  This may take place during the request for
    network access and/or subsequently at any time while connected to the network.  The
    learned posture information can then be applied to a variety of compliance-oriented
    decisions.  The posture information is frequently useful for detecting systems
    that are lacking or have out-of-date security protection mechanisms such as: anti-virus
    and host-based firewall software.  In order to provide context for the requirements,
    a reference model and terminology are introduced.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.'
