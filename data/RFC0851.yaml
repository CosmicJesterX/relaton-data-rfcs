abstract:
  content: This RFC specifies the ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol, which is a successor
    to the existing 1822 Host Access Protocol.  1822L allows ARPANET hosts to use
    logical names as well as 1822's physical port locations to address each other.  This
    RFC is also being presented as a solicitation of comments on 1822L, especially
    from host network software implementers and maintainers.  Obsoletes RFC 802.
