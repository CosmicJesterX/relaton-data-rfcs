abstract:
- content: This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained
    web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other relationships
    between links.  Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC 5988, the Constrained
    RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format is carried as a payload and is assigned
    an Internet media type. "RESTful" refers to the Representational State Transfer
    (REST) architecture.  A well-known URI is defined as a default entry point for
    requesting the links hosted by a server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
