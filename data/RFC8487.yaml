abstract:
  content: This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named Mtrace
    version 2 (Mtrace2).  Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2 requires special implementations
    on the part of routers.  This specification describes the required functionality
    in multicast routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a Query and receives
    a Reply.
