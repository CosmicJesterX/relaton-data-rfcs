abstract:
- content: The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation
    in support of traffic engineering (TE) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. When a Path Computation Client (PCC) requests
    a PCE for a route, it may be useful for the PCC to specify, as constraints to
    the path computation, abstract nodes, resources, and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs)
    that are to be explicitly excluded from the computed route. Such constraints are
    termed "route exclusions". The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as
    a communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs. This document presents PCEP extensions
    for route exclusions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
