abstract:
  content: This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) option
    that is in active use to carry information about the network that originated a
    DNS query and the network for which the subsequent response can be cached.  Since
    it has some known operational and privacy shortcomings, a revision will be worked
    through the IETF for improvement.
