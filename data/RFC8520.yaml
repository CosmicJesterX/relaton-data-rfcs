abstract:
  content: This memo specifies a component-based architecture for Manufacturer Usage
    Descriptions (MUDs). The goal of MUD is to provide a means for end devices to
    signal to the network what sort of access and network functionality they require
    to properly function. The initial focus is on access control. Later work can delve
    into other aspects. This memo specifies two YANG modules, IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options,
    a Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) TLV, a URL, an X.509 certificate extension,
    and a means to sign and verify the descriptions.
