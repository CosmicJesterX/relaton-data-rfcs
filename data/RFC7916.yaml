abstract:
  content: Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs), as defined in RFC 5286, constitute an IP Fast
    Reroute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic (and, by
    extension, MPLS LDP traffic). Following early deployment experiences, this document
    provides operational feedback on LFAs, highlights some limitations, and proposes
    a set of refinements to address those limitations. It also proposes required management
    specifications. This proposal is also applicable to remote-LFA solutions.
