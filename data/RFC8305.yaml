abstract:
- content: Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use hostnames.  These
    often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of which may have different performance
    and connectivity characteristics.  Since specific addresses or address families
    (IPv4 or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients that
    attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of establishing a connection
    more quickly.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce
    this user-visible delay and provides an example algorithm, referred to as "Happy
    Eyeballs".  This document obsoletes the original algorithm description in RFC
    6555.
