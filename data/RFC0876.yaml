abstract:
  content: This RFC is a survey of implementation status.  It does not specify an
    official protocol, but rather notes the status of implementation of aspects of
    a protocol.  It is expected that the status of the hosts reported on will change.  This
    information must be treated as a snapshot of the state of these implemetations.
