abstract:
  content: This document describes data structures and API support for Mobile IPv6
    as an extension to the Advanced Socket API for IPv6. Just as the Advanced Sockets
    API for IPv6 gives access to various extension headers and the ICMPv6 protocol,
    this document specifies the same level of access for Mobile IPv6 components. It
    specifies a mechanism for applications to retrieve and set information for Mobility
    Header messages, Home Address destination options, and Routing Header Type 2 extension
    headers. It also specifies the common data structures and definitions that might
    be used by certain advanced Mobile IPv6 socket applications. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
