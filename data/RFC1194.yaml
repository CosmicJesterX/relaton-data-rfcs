abstract:
- content: This memo describes the Finger User Information Protocol.  This is a simple
    protocol which provides an interface to a remote user information program.  Based
    on RFC 742, a description of the original Finger protocol, this memo attempts
    to clarify the expected communication between the two ends of a Finger connection.  It
    also tries not to invalidate the many existing implementations or add unnecessary
    restrictions to the original protocol definition. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
