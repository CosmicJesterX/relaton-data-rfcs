abstract:
- content: A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between
    SMTP Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), including STARTTLS, DNS- Based Authentication
    of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA, and MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS).  These
    protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or active attack, leading to undelivered
    messages or delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels.  This document
    describes a reporting mechanism and format by which sending systems can share
    statistics and specific information about potential failures with recipient domains.  Recipient
    domains can then use this information to both detect potential attacks and diagnose
    unintentional misconfigurations.
