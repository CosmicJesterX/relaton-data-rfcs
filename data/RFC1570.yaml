abstract:
- content: The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP defines an extensible
    Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link
    connection.  This document defines several additional LCP features which have
    been suggested over the past few years. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
