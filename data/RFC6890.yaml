abstract:
  content: This memo reiterates the assignment of an IPv4 address block (192.0.0.0/24)
    to IANA.  It also instructs IANA to restructure its IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose
    Address Registries.  Upon restructuring, the aforementioned registries will record
    all special-purpose address blocks, maintaining a common set of information regarding
    each address block.
