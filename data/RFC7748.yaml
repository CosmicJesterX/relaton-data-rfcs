abstract:
  content: This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer a
    high level of practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport
    Layer Security (TLS).  These curves are intended to operate at the ~128-bit and
    ~224-bit security level, respectively, and are generated deterministically based
    on a list of required properties.
