abstract:
- content: The purpose of this specification is to provide a framework for analyzing
    the multiplexing characteristics of Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes
    when SDP is used to negotiate the usage of a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving
    media associated with multiple media descriptions. This specification also categorizes
    the existing SDP attributes based on the framework described herein.
