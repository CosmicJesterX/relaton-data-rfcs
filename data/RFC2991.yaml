abstract:
  content: The effect of multipath routing on a forwarder is that the forwarder potentially
    has several next-hops for any given destination and must use some method to choose
    which next-hop should be used for a given data packet.  This memo summarizes current
    practices, problems, and solutions.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
