abstract:
- content: This document describes an end-to-end session identifier for use in IP-based
    multimedia communication systems that enables endpoints, intermediary devices,
    and management systems to identify a session end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints
    with a given multipoint conference, track communication sessions when they are
    redirected, and associate one or more media flows with a given communication session.
    While the identifier is intended to work across multiple protocols, this document
    describes its usage in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This document also
    describes a backwards-compatibility mechanism for an existing session identifier
    implementation (RFC 7329) that is sufficiently different from the procedures defined
    in this document. This document obsoletes RFC 7329.
