abstract:
  content: This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version
    1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version
    0, which is specified in RFC 3530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  Major
    extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory
    Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1 has no dependencies
    on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate protocol.  Thus,
    this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is
    deemed superior to NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its
    use is preferred over version 0.  Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be used
    simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
