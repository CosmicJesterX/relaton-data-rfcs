abstract:
  content: This document describes a method of representing rules for validating identifier
    labels and alternate representations of those labels using Extensible Markup Language
    (XML).  These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs), are used
    for the implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), for example.  The
    rulesets are used to implement and share that aspect of policy defining which
    labels and Unicode code points are permitted for registrations, which alternative
    code points are considered variants, and what actions may be performed on labels
    containing those variants.
