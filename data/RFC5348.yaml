abstract:
- content: This document specifies TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). TFRC is a congestion
    control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment.
    It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much
    lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable
    for applications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate
    is of importance. This document obsoletes RFC 3448 and updates RFC 4342. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
