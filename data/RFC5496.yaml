abstract:
  content: This document describes a use of the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
    Join Attribute as defined in RFC 5384, which enables PIM to build multicast trees
    through an MPLS-enabled network, even if that network's IGP does not have a route
    to the source of the tree. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
