abstract:
  content: The BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute provides a mechanism for BGP speakers
    to convey to an adjacent AS the optimal entry point into the local AS. While BGP
    MEDs function correctly in many scenarios, a number of issues may arise when utilizing
    MEDs in dynamic or complex topologies. This document discusses implementation
    and deployment considerations regarding BGP MEDs and provides information with
    which implementers and network operators should be familiar. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
