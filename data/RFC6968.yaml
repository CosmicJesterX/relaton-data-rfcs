abstract:
  content: This document introduces the FCAST reliable object (e.g., file) delivery
    application.  It is designed to operate either on top of the underlying Asynchronous
    Layered Coding (ALC) / Layered Coding Transport (LCT) reliable multicast transport
    protocol or the NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) transport protocol.
