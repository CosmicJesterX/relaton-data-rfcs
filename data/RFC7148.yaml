abstract:
  content: This specification defines extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
    for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain IP prefixes
    for its attached mobile networks using DHCPv6 prefix delegation.  Network-based
    mobility management support is provided for those delegated IP prefixes just as
    it is provided for the mobile node's home address.  Even if the mobile router
    performs a handoff and changes its network point of attachment, mobility support
    is ensured for all the delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile
    network that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes.
