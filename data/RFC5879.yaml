abstract:
  content: This document describes a set of heuristics for distinguishing IPsec ESP-NULL
    (Encapsulating Security Payload without encryption) packets from encrypted ESP
    packets.  These heuristics can be used on intermediate devices, like traffic analyzers,
    and deep-inspection engines, to quickly decide whether or not a given packet flow
    is encrypted, i.e., whether or not it can be inspected.  Use of these heuristics
    does not require any changes made on existing IPsec hosts that are compliant with
    RFC 4303.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.
