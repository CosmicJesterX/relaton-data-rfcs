abstract:
  content: The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks will introduce cases
    where connectivity with IPv4 networks crossing IPv6 transit backbones is desired.  This
    document describes a mechanism for automatic discovery and creation of IPv4-over-IPv6
    tunnels via extensions to multiprotocol BGP.  It is targeted at connecting islands
    of IPv4 networks across an IPv6-only backbone without the need for a manually
    configured overlay of tunnels.  The mechanisms described in this document have
    been implemented, tested, and deployed on the large research IPv6 network in China.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
