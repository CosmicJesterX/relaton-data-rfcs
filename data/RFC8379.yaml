abstract:
- content: When a link is being prepared to be taken out of service, the traffic needs
    to be diverted from both ends of the link. Increasing the metric to the highest
    value on one side of the link is not sufficient to divert the traffic flowing
    in the other direction. It is useful for the routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing
    domain to be able to advertise a link as being in a graceful-shutdown state to
    indicate impending maintenance activity on the link. This information can be used
    by the network devices to reroute the traffic effectively. This document describes
    the protocol extensions to disseminate graceful-link-shutdown information in OSPFv2
    and OSPFv3.
