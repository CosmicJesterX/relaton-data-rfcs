abstract:
  content: Advancing a protocol to Draft Standard requires documentation of the interoperation
    and implementation of the protocol.  Historic reports have varied widely in form
    and level of content and there is little guidance available to new report preparers.  This
    document updates the existing processes and provides more detail on what is appropriate
    in an interoperability and implementation report.  This document specifies an
    Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.
