abstract:
  content: This document defines a new OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV that allows
    OSPF routers to flood their hostname-to-Router-ID mapping information across an
    OSPF network to provide a simple and dynamic mechanism for routers running OSPF
    to learn about symbolic hostnames, just like for routers running IS-IS.  This
    mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
