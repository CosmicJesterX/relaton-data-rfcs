abstract:
  content: The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a Network
    Address Translator (NAT) traversal mechanism for UDP-based multimedia sessions
    established with the Offer/Answer model. The ICE extension for Incremental Provisioning
    of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a mechanism that allows ICE Agents to shorten
    session establishment delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity
    checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing them in parallel. This document
    defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
    The document also defines a new SIP Info Package to support this usage together
    with the corresponding media type. Additionally, a new Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) "end-of-candidates" attribute and a new SIP option tag "trickle-ice" are
    defined.
