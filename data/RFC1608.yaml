abstract:
  content: This document describes the objects necessary to include information about
    IP networks and IP numbers in the X.500 Directory.  It extends the work "Charting
    networks in the X.500 Directory" [1] where a general framework is presented for
    representing networks in the Directory by applying it to IP networks.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
