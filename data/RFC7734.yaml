abstract:
- content: This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode (SPBM)
    can be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to interwork with Provider Backbone Bridging
    Provider Edges (PBB PEs) as described in the PBB-EVPN solution (RFC 7623).  This
    is achieved via operational isolation of each Ethernet network attached to an
    EVPN core while supporting full interworking between the different variations
    of Ethernet networks.
