abstract:
  content: This document is a history capturing the background, motivation and thinking
    during the LEMONADE definition and design process. The LEMONADE Working Group
    -- Internet email to support diverse service environments -- is chartered to provide
    enhancements to Internet mail to facilitate its use by more diverse clients. In
    particular, by clients on hosts not only operating in environments with high latency/bandwidth-limited
    unreliable links but also constrained to limited resources. The enhanced mail
    must be backwards compatible with existing Internet mail. The primary motivation
    for this effort is -- by making Internet mail protocols richer and more adaptable
    to varied media and environments -- to allow mobile handheld devices tetherless
    access to Internet mail using only IETF mail protocols. The requirements for these
    devices drive a discussion of the possible protocol enhancements needed to support
    multimedia messaging on limited-capability hosts in diverse service environments.
    A list of general principles to guide the design of the enhanced messaging protocols
    is documented. Finally, additional issues of providing seamless service between
    enhanced Internet mail and the existing separate mobile messaging infrastructure
    are briefly listed. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
