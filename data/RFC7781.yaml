abstract:
  content: The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides support for flow-level multipathing for both unicast and multi-destination
    traffic in networks with arbitrary topology.  Active-active access at the TRILL
    edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply
    connected to a TRILL campus as discussed in RFC 7379.  In this document, the edge
    RBridge (Routing Bridge, or TRILL switch) group providing active-active access
    to such an end station is represented as a virtual RBridge.  Based on the concept
    of the virtual RBridge, along with its pseudo-nickname, this document specifies
    a method for TRILL active-active access by such end stations.
