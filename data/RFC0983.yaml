abstract:
  content: This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet
    community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session, presentation,
    and application recommendations which have been adopted by the international community
    and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent possible, it is desirable to offer
    these higher level services directly in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting
    existing facilities.  This permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT
    applications which previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention
    is that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP services
    on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this standard.  Suggestions
    for improvement are encouraged.
