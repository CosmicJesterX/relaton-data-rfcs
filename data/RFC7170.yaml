abstract:
  content: This document defines the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP)
    version 1.  TEAP is a tunnel-based EAP method that enables secure communication
    between a peer and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
    to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  Within the tunnel, TLV objects
    are used to convey authentication-related data between the EAP peer and the EAP
    server.
