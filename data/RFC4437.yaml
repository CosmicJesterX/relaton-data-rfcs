abstract:
- content: This specification defines an extension to Web Distributed Authoring and
    Versioning (WebDAV) to allow clients to author HTTP redirect reference resources
    whose default response is an HTTP/1.1 3xx (Redirection) status code.  A redirect
    reference makes it possible to access the target resourced indirectly through
    any URI mapped to the redirect reference resource.  This specification does not
    address remapping of trees of resources or regular expression based redirections.  There
    are no integrity guarantees associated with redirect reference resources.  Other
    mechanisms can also be used to achieve the same functionality as this specification.  This
    specification allows operators to experiment with this mechanism and develop experience
    on what is the best approach to the problem.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.
