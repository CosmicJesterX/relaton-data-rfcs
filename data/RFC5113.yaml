abstract:
- content: When multiple access networks are available, users may have difficulty
    in selecting which network to connect to and how to authenticate with that network.  This
    document defines the network discovery and selection problem, dividing it into
    multiple sub- problems.  Some constraints on potential solutions are outlined,
    and the limitations of several solutions (including existing ones) are discussed.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
