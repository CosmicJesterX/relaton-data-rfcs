abstract:
  content: This document specifies a mechanism for a host to indicate via the Port
    Control Protocol (PCP) which connections should be protected against network failures.
    These connections will then be subject to high-availability mechanisms enabled
    on the network side. This approach assumes that applications and/or users have
    more visibility about sensitive connections than any heuristic that can be enabled
    on the network side to guess which connections should be check-pointed.
