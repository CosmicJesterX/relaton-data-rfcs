abstract:
- content: 'Tunneling techniques such as IP-in-IP when deployed in the middle of the
    network, typically between routers, have certain issues regarding how large packets
    can be handled: whether such packets would be fragmented and reassembled (and
    how), whether Path MTU Discovery would be used, or how this scenario could be
    operationally avoided.  This memo justifies why this is a common, non-trivial
    problem, and goes on to describe the different solutions and their characteristics
    at some length.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.'
