abstract:
  content: This document describes a RTP (Real-Time Protocol) payload format for transporting
    MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) 1 or 2, layer III audio (commonly known as
    "MP3").  This format is an alternative to that described in RFC 2250, and performs
    better if there is packet loss. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
