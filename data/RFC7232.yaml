abstract:
- content: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application- level
    protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.  This
    document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields
    for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on
    such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request
    when one or more preconditions evaluate to false.
