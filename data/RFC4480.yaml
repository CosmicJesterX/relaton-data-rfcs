abstract:
  content: The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format for
    representing presence information for a presentity. This format defines a textual
    note, an indication of availability (open or closed) and a Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) for communication. The Rich Presence Information Data format (RPID) described
    here is an extension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information Data
    Format (PIDF). These extensions provide additional information about the presentity
    and its contacts. The information is designed so that much of it can be derived
    automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user activity. This extension includes
    information about what the person is doing, a grouping identifier for a tuple,
    when a service or device was last used, the type of place a person is in, what
    media communications might remain private, the relationship of a service tuple
    to another presentity, the person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the
    type of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's status, and the
    overall role of the presentity. These extensions include presence information
    for persons, services (tuples), and devices. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
