abstract:
- content: This specification defines how the Uniform Resource Name (URN) reserved
    for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) identities
    and its sub-namespace for the International Mobile station Equipment Identity
    (IMEI) can be used as an instance-id.  Its purpose is to fulfill the requirements
    for defining how a specific URN needs to be constructed and used in the '+sip.instance'
    Contact header field parameter for outbound behavior.
