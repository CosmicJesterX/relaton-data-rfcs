abstract:
- content: The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key management
    scheme for real-time applications.  In this document, we note that the currently
    defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios built around
    a centralized key management service.  Interest in such deployments is increasing.  Therefore,
    a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios are defined.  The new
    modes use a trusted key management service and a ticket concept, similar to that
    in Kerberos.  The new modes also support features used by many existing applications,
    where the exact identity of the other endpoint may not be known at the start of
    the communication session.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
