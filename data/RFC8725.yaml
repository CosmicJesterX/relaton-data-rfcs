abstract:
- content: JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs, are URL-safe JSON-based security tokens
    that contain a set of claims that can be signed and/or encrypted.  JWTs are being
    widely used and deployed as a simple security token format in numerous protocols
    and applications, both in the area of digital identity and in other application
    areas.  This Best Current Practices document updates RFC 7519 to provide actionable
    guidance leading to secure implementation and deployment of JWTs.
