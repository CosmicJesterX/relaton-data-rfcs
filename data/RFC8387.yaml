abstract:
- content: This memo describes challenges associated with securing resource- constrained
    smart object devices.  The memo describes a possible deployment model where resource-constrained
    devices sign message objects, discusses the availability of cryptographic libraries
    for resource-constrained devices, and presents some preliminary experiences with
    those libraries for message signing on resource- constrained devices.  Lastly,
    the memo discusses trade-offs involving different types of security approaches.
