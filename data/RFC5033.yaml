abstract:
  content: The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to
    be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).  Recent research
    has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ
    from the IETF's congestion control principles.  Using these new congestion control
    schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic
    using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized
    congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing
    with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this document is to
    provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within
    the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
