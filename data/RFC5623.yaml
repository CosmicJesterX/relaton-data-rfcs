abstract:
  content: A network may comprise multiple layers. It is important to globally optimize
    network resource utilization, taking into account all layers rather than optimizing
    resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows better network efficiency
    to be achieved through a process that we call inter-layer traffic engineering.
    The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to achieve inter-layer
    traffic engineering. This document describes a framework for applying the PCE-based
    architecture to inter-layer Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) traffic engineering. It provides suggestions for the deployment of
    PCE in support of multi-layer networks. This document also describes network models
    where PCE performs inter-layer traffic engineering, and the relationship between
    PCE and a functional component called the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM).
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.
