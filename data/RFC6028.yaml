abstract:
  content: This document specifies two extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
    to implement multi-hop routing.  The first extension allows implementing source
    routing in HIP.  That is, a node sending a HIP packet can define a set of nodes
    that the HIP packet should traverse.  The second extension allows a HIP packet
    to carry and record the list of nodes that forwarded it.  This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
