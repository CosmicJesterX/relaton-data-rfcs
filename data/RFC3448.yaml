abstract:
  content: This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a congestion
    control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best- effort Internet environment.  It
    is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much
    lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable
    for applications such as telephony or streaming media where a relatively smooth
    sending rate is of importance. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
