- content: This note identifies the key infrastructure protocols of the Internet Protocol
    Suite for use in the Smart Grid.  The target audience is those people seeking
    guidance on how to construct an appropriate Internet Protocol Suite profile for
    the Smart Grid.  In practice, such a profile would consist of selecting what is
    needed for Smart Grid deployment from the picture presented here.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
