abstract:
  content: Hierarchical Service Function Chaining (hSFC) is a network architecture
    allowing an organization to decompose a large-scale network into multiple domains
    of administration. The goals of hSFC are to make a large-scale network easier
    to design, simpler to control, and supportive of independent functional groups
    within large network operators.
