abstract:
  content: Previous RFCs specify the procedures necessary to allow IP multicast traffic
    to travel from one site to another within a BGP/MPLS IP VPN (Virtual Private Network).  However,
    it is sometimes desirable to allow multicast traffic whose source is in one VPN
    to be received by systems that are in another VPN.  This is known as a "Multicast
    VPN (MVPN) extranet".  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by specifying
    the procedures that are necessary in order to provide extranet MVPN service.
