abstract:
  content: '"Differentiated Services (Diffserv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering Requirements",
    RFC 3564, specifies the requirements and selection criteria for Bandwidth Constraints
    Models.  Two such models, the Maximum Allocation and the Russian Dolls, are described
    therein.  This document complements RFC 3564 by presenting the results of a performance
    evaluation of these two models under various operational conditions: normal load,
    overload, preemption fully or partially enabled, pure blocking, or complete sharing.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.'
