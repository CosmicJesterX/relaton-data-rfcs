abstract:
  content: Z39.50 is an information retrieval protocol that does not fit neatly into
    a retrieval model designed primarily around the stateless fetch of data.  Instead,
    it models a general user inquiry as a session-oriented, multi-step task, any step
    of which may be suspended temporarily while the server requests additional parameters
    from the client before continuing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
