abstract:
- content: This memo registers the Enumservice "vCard" using the URI schemes "http"
    and "https". This Enumservice is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain name
    to a vCard instance describing the user of the respective E.164 number. Information
    gathered from those vCards could be used before, during, or after inbound or outbound
    communication takes place. For example, a callee might be presented with the name
    and association of the caller before picking up the call. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
