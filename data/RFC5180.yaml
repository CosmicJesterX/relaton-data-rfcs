abstract:
- content: The benchmarking methodologies defined in RFC 2544 are IP version independent.  However,
    RFC 2544 does not address some of the specificities of IPv6.  This document provides
    additional benchmarking guidelines, which in conjunction with RFC 2544, lead to
    a more complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance of network interconnect
    devices.  IPv6 transition mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
