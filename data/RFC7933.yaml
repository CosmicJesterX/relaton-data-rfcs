abstract:
  content: 'This document considers the consequences of moving the underlying network
    architecture from the current Internet to an Information- Centric Networking (ICN)
    architecture on video distribution.  As most of the traffic in future networks
    is expected to be video, we consider how to modify the existing video streaming
    mechanisms.  Several important topics related to video distribution over ICN are
    presented.  The wide range of scenarios covered includes the following: evolving
    Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) to work over ICN and leverage the
    recent ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standard, layering encoding
    over ICN, introducing distinct requirements for video using Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
    mechanisms, adapting the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) for ICN, creating
    more stringent requirements over ICN because of delay constraints added by Internet
    Protocol Television (IPTV), and managing digital rights in ICN.  Finally, in addition
    to considering how existing mechanisms would be impacted by ICN, this document
    lists some research issues to design ICN-specific video streaming mechanisms.'
