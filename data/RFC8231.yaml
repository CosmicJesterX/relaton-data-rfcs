abstract:
  content: The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms
    for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response
    to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests. Although PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions
    regarding the information available to the PCE, it also makes no provisions for
    PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations within and across PCEP
    sessions. This document describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
    control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via PCEP.
