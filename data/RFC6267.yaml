abstract:
- content: This document describes a key management protocol variant for the Multimedia
    Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol that relies on a trusted key management service.  In
    particular, this variant utilizes Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE)
    framework that allows the participating clients to perform mutual authentication
    and derive a session key in an asymmetric Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) framework.  This
    protocol, in addition to providing mutual authentication, eliminates the key escrow
    problem that is common in standard IBE and provides perfect forward and backward
    secrecy.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.
