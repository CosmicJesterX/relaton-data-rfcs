abstract:
  content: The Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) protocol is an
    application protocol conceived for the description and negotiation of a telepresence
    session.  The design of the CLUE protocol takes into account the requirements
    and the framework defined within the IETF CLUE Working Group.  A companion document,
    RFC 8848, delves into CLUE signaling details as well as the SIP / Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) session establishment phase.  CLUE messages flow over the CLUE
    data channel, based on reliable and ordered SCTP-over-DTLS transport. ("SCTP"
    stands for "Stream Control Transmission Protocol".) Message details, together
    with the behavior of CLUE Participants acting as Media Providers and/or Media
    Consumers, are herein discussed.
