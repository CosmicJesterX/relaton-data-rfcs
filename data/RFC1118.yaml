abstract:
- content: This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet community in order
    to make available some "hints" which will allow new network participants to understand
    how the direction of the Internet is set, how to acquire online information and
    how to be a good Internet neighbor.  While the information discussed may not be
    relevant to the research problems of the Internet, it may be interesting to a
    number of researchers and implementors.  No standards are defined or specified
    in this memo.
