abstract:
- content: This memo describes the use of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
    (RADIUS) authentication and authorization service with Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP) secure Transport Models to authenticate users and authorize creation
    of secure transport sessions.  While the recommendations of this memo are generally
    applicable to a broad class of SNMP Transport Models, the examples focus on the
    Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Model. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
