abstract:
  content: This document specifies how DNS resource records are named and structured
    to facilitate service discovery.  Given a type of service that a client is looking
    for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this mechanism
    allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service,
    using standard DNS queries.  This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service
    Discovery, or DNS-SD.
