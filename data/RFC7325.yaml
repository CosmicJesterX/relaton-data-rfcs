abstract:
  content: This document provides guidelines for implementers regarding MPLS forwarding
    and a basis for evaluations of forwarding implementations.  Guidelines cover many
    aspects of MPLS forwarding.  Topics are highlighted where implementers might otherwise
    overlook practical requirements which are unstated or under emphasized or are
    optional for conformance to RFCs but are often considered mandatory by providers.
