abstract:
  content: This document allocates a formal Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
    for assignment by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as specified
    in RFC 3406.  At this time, the URN will be used primarily to uniquely identify
    Extensible Markup Language (XML) artefacts that provide information about NATO
    message text formats and service specifications as described in various NATO standards,
    instructions, and publications.
