abstract:
- content: This document describes the LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) Map-Versioning
    mechanism, which provides in-packet information about Endpoint ID to Routing Locator
    (EID-to-RLOC) mappings used to encapsulate LISP data packets.  The proposed approach
    is based on associating a version number to EID-to-RLOC mappings and the transport
    of such a version number in the LISP-specific header of LISP-encapsulated packets.  LISP
    Map-Versioning is particularly useful to inform communicating Ingress Tunnel Routers
    (ITRs) and Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) about modifications of the mappings used
    to encapsulate packets.  The mechanism is transparent to implementations not supporting
    this feature, since in the LISP- specific header and in the Map Records, bits
    used for Map-Versioning can be safely ignored by ITRs and ETRs that do not support
    the mechanism.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.
