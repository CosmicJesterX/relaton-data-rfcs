abstract:
- content: This document provides background information regarding large-scale Kerberos
    deployments in the industrial sector, with the aim of identifying issues in the
    current Kerberos cross-realm authentication model as defined in RFC 4120. This
    document describes some examples of actual large-scale industrial systems, and
    lists requirements and restrictions regarding authentication operations in such
    environments. It also identifies a number of requirements derived from the industrial
    automation field. Although they are found in the field of industrial automation,
    these requirements are general enough and are applicable to the problem of Kerberos
    cross-realm operations. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
