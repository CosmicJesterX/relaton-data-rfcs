abstract:
  content: This document describes open research challenges for network virtualization.  Network
    virtualization is following a similar path as previously taken by cloud computing.  Specifically,
    cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions (e.g., applications)
    and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to remote virtual functions
    accessible through the Internet.  In a similar manner, network virtualization
    is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated physical hardware
    nodes to a virtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can
    be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not only
    involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves abstraction
    of the network itself.  This document describes current research and engineering
    challenges in network virtualization including the guarantee of quality of service,
    performance improvement, support for multiple domains, network slicing, service
    composition, device virtualization, privacy and security, separation of control
    concerns, network function placement, and testing.  In addition, some proposals
    are made for new activities in the IETF and IRTF that could address some of these
    challenges.  This document is a product of the Network Function Virtualization
    Research Group (NFVRG).
