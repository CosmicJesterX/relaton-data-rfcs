abstract:
  content: This document analyzes security threats to Simplified Multicast Forwarding
    (SMF), including vulnerabilities of duplicate packet detection and relay set selection
    mechanisms. This document is not intended to propose solutions to the threats
    described. In addition, this document updates RFC 7186 regarding threats to the
    relay set selection mechanisms using the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood
    Discovery Protocol (NHDP) (RFC 6130).
