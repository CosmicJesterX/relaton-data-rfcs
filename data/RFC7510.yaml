abstract:
- content: This document specifies an IP-based encapsulation for MPLS, called MPLS-in-UDP
    for situations where UDP (User Datagram Protocol) encapsulation is preferred to
    direct use of MPLS, e.g., to enable UDP-based ECMP (Equal-Cost Multipath) or link
    aggregation.  The MPLS- in-UDP encapsulation technology must only be deployed
    within a single network (with a single network operator) or networks of an adjacent
    set of cooperating network operators where traffic is managed to avoid congestion,
    rather than over the Internet where congestion control is required.  Usage restrictions
    apply to MPLS-in-UDP usage for traffic that is not congestion controlled and to
    UDP zero checksum usage with IPv6.
