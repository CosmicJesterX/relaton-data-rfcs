abstract:
  content: Overhead due to the movement of user data in the end-system network I/O
    processing path at high speeds is significant, and has limited the use of Internet
    protocols in interconnection networks, and the Internet itself -- especially where
    high bandwidth, low latency, and/or low overhead are required by the hosted application.
    This document examines this overhead, and addresses an architectural, IP-based
    "copy avoidance" solution for its elimination, by enabling Remote Direct Memory
    Access (RDMA). This memo provides information for the Internet community.
