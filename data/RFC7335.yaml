abstract:
- content: Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite), defined in RFC 6333, directs IANA to reserve
    192.0.0.0/29 for the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.  Per this memo, IANA
    has generalized that reservation to include other cases where a non-routed IPv4
    interface must be numbered as part of an IPv6 transition solution.
