abstract:
- content: The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.  In
    this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere
    of address management or path computational responsibility such as an Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS).  This document specifies
    a representation and encoding of a domain sequence, which is defined as an ordered
    sequence of domains traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path
    Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain constrained shortest paths
    across a predetermined sequence of domains.  This document also defines new subobjects
    to be used to encode domain identifiers.
