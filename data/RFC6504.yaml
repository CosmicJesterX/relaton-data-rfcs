abstract:
  content: This document provides detailed call flows for the scenarios documented
    in the Framework for Centralized Conferencing (XCON) (RFC 5239) and in the XCON
    scenarios (RFC 4597).  The call flows document the use of the interface between
    a conference control client and a conference control server using the Centralized
    Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) (RFC 6503).  The objective is to provide
    detailed examples for reference by both protocol researchers and developers.  This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.
