abstract:
  content: This document describes Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA), a novel
    congestion control scheme for interactive real-time media applications such as
    video conferencing.  In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending
    rate, based on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified
    approach.  The scheme can benefit from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
    markings from network nodes.  It also maintains consistent sender behavior in
    the absence of such markings by reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead.
