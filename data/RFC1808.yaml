abstract:
  content: In situations where the base URL is well-defined and known to the parser
    (human or machine), it is useful to be able to embed URL references which inherit
    that context rather than re-specifying it in every instance.  This document defines
    the syntax and semantics for such Relative Uniform Resource Locators. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
