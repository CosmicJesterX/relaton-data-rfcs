abstract:
- content: This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the ARPA-Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The recent
    interest within the Internet community in determining accurate time from a set
    of mutually suspicious network clocks has been prompted by several occasions in
    which errors were found in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms
    which disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added
    those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator mistakes,
    as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and synchronize clocks.  This
    report suggests a stochastic model and algorithms for computing a good estimator
    from time-offset samples measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included
    in this report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication
    of the effectiveness of the algorithms.
