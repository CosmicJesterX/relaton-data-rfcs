abstract:
  content: A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing system,
    known as "route leaks", has received significant attention in recent years.  Frequent
    incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet routing are labeled
    route leaks, but to date a common definition of the term has been lacking.  This
    document provides a working definition of route leaks while keeping in mind the
    real occurrences that have received significant attention.  Further, this document
    attempts to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different types of route leaks
    based on observed events on the Internet.  The aim is to provide a taxonomy that
    covers several forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern
    to the Internet user community as well as the network operator community.
