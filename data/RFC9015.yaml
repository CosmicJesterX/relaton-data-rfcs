abstract:
  content: This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for networks
    that support service function chaining. The document introduces a new BGP address
    family called the "Service Function Chain (SFC) Address Family Identifier / Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier" (SFC AFI/SAFI) with two Route Types. One Route Type
    is originated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance of a
    specified service function. This Route Type also provides "instructions" on how
    to send a packet to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service
    function has to be applied to the packet. The other Route Type is used by a controller
    to advertise the paths of "chains" of service functions and give a unique designator
    to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction with the Network Service
    Header (NSH) defined in RFC 8300. This document adopts the service function chaining
    architecture described in RFC 7665.
