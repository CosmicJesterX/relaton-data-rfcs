abstract:
- content: This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal to
    its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish their adjacencies
    without cycling through the down state, while still correctly initiating database
    synchronization. This document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting
    router to determine when it has achieved Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) database
    synchronization with its neighbors and a mechanism to optimize LSP database synchronization,
    while minimizing transient routing disruption when a router starts. This document
    obsoletes RFC 3847. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
