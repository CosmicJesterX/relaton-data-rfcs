abstract:
  content: Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that are
    not globally unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC 1918 for private
    use within individual sites. Devices in such environments may occasionally originate
    Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding to
    those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned have only local significance,
    it is good practice for site administrators to ensure that such queries are answered
    locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation
    path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the site. It is not possible
    for public DNS servers to give useful answers to such queries. In addition, due
    to the wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing growth of the
    Internet, the volume of such queries is large and growing. The AS112 project aims
    to provide a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on
    the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers. The AS112 project is named after the Autonomous
    System Number (ASN) that was assigned to it. This document describes the steps
    required to install a new AS112 node and offers advice relating to such a node's
    operation. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.
