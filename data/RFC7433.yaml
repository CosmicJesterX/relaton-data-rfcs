abstract:
  content: There is a class of applications that benefit from using SIP to exchange
    User-to-User Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This information,
    known as call control UUI data, is a small piece of data inserted by an application
    initiating the session and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The
    syntax and semantics for the UUI data used by a specific application are defined
    by a UUI package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated
    to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User,
    to transport UUI data, along with an extension mechanism.
