abstract:
  content: Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like Squid support
    event logging using a common log format.  The logs produced using these de facto
    standard formats are invaluable to system administrators for troubleshooting a
    server and tool writers to craft tools that mine the log files and produce reports
    and trends.  Furthermore, these log files can also be used to train anomaly detection
    systems and feed events into a security event management system.  The Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) does not have a common log format, and, as a result,
    each server supports a distinct log format that makes it unnecessarily complex
    to produce tools to do trend analysis and security detection.  This document describes
    a framework, including requirements and analysis of existing approaches, and specifies
    an information model for development of a SIP common log file format that can
    be used uniformly by user agents, proxies, registrars, and redirect servers as
    well as back-to-back user agents.
