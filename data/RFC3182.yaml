abstract:
  content: This document describes the representation of identity information in POLICY_DATA
    object for supporting policy based admission control in the Resource ReSerVation
    Protocol (RSVP).  The goal of identity representation is to allow a process on
    a system to securely identify the owner and the application of the communicating
    process (e.g., user id) and convey this information in RSVP messages (PATH or
    RESV) in a secure manner.  We describe the encoding of identities as RSVP policy
    element.  We describe the processing rules to generate identity policy elements
    for multicast merged flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
