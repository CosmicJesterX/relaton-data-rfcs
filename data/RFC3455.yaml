abstract:
  content: This document describes a set of private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    headers (P-headers) used by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), along
    with their applicability, which is limited to particular environments.  The P-headers
    are for a variety of purposes within the networks that the partners use, including
    charging and information about the networks a call traverses.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
