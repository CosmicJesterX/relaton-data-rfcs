abstract:
- content: As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks progresses,
    a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to the Internet.  Standardization
    organizations have made the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their
    specifications.  However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous
    specifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of
    bandwidth, cost, and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is used.  This
    document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet Radio
    Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved
    Packet System (EPS) networks (hereafter collectively referred to as Third Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) networks).  This document also lists specific IPv6
    functionalities that need to be implemented in addition to what is already prescribed
    in the IPv6 Node Requirements document (RFC 6434).  It also discusses some issues
    related to the use of these components when operating in these networks.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 3316.
