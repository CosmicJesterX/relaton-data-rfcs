abstract:
- content: The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) effort aims to complement
    ingress filtering with finer-grained, standardized IP source address validation.  This
    document describes threats enabled by IP source address spoofing both in the global
    and finer-grained context, describes currently available solutions and challenges,
    and provides a starting point analysis for finer-grained (host granularity) anti-spoofing
    work.
