abstract:
- content: SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request routing
    loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP requests with new
    Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the difficulties associated with
    loop detection for B2BUAs and the requirements for them to prevent infinite loops.
