abstract:
  content: The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query
    parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters are
    encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers.
    While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through the
    user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted,
    b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication
    through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several
    attacks to the protocol have now been put forward. This document introduces the
    ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows
    the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON
    Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality
    properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent
    by value or by reference.
