abstract:
  content: This informational document describes and identifies the requirements for
    transactions to handle Public Key Certificate (PKC) lifecycle transactions between
    Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Systems using
    Internet Key Exchange (IKE) (versions 1 and 2) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    Systems.  These requirements are designed to meet the needs of enterprise-scale
    IPsec VPN deployments.  It is intended that a standards track profile of a management
    protocol will be created to address many of these requirements.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
