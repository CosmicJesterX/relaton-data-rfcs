abstract:
  content: This document specifies how to use Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
    (ECDSA) with XML Signatures.  The mechanism specified provides integrity, message
    authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether
    located within the XML that includes the signature or included by reference.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
