abstract:
  content: Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 142 defines P_MUL, which is a protocol
    for reliable multicast suitable for bandwidth-constrained and delayed acknowledgement
    (Emissions Control or "EMCON") environments running over UDP. This document defines
    MULE (Multicast Email), an application protocol for transferring Internet Mail
    messages (as described in RFC 5322) over P_MUL (as defined in ACP 142). MULE enables
    transfer between Message Transfer Agents (MTAs). It doesn't provide a service
    similar to SMTP Submission (as described in RFC 6409). This document explains
    how MULE can be used in conjunction with SMTP (RFC 5321), including some common
    SMTP extensions, to provide an alternate MTA-to-MTA transfer mechanism. This is
    not an IETF specification; it describes an existing implementation. It is provided
    in order to facilitate interoperable implementations and third-party diagnostics.
