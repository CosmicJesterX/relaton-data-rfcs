abstract:
- content: In some application scenarios, it may be desirable to send multiple differently
    encoded versions of the same media source in different RTP streams.  This is called
    simulcast.  This document describes how to accomplish simulcast in RTP and how
    to signal it in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The described solution
    uses an RTP/RTCP identification method to identify RTP streams belonging to the
    same media source and makes an extension to SDP to indicate that those RTP streams
    are different simulcast formats of that media source.  The SDP extension consists
    of a new media-level SDP attribute that expresses capability to send and/or receive
    simulcast RTP streams.
