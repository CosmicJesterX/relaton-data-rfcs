abstract:
  content: This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology related to benchmarking SIP
    devices is described in the companion methodology document (RFC 7502).  Using
    these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types
    of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border Controllers.  The
    term "performance" in this context means the capacity of the Device Under Test
    (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to study how they
    impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide
    a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity
    of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are necessary because
    SIP allows a wide range of configurations and operational conditions that can
    influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology
    will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained following
    the same procedures.
