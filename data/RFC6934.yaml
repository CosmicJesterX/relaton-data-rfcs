abstract:
  content: The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of the Access
    Node Control Mechanism to broadband access based on Passive Optical Networks (PONs).  The
    need for an Access Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS)
    and an Access Node Complex, composed of a combination of Optical Line Termination
    (OLT) and Optical Network Termination (ONT) elements, is described in a multi-service
    reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related, and subscriber-related
    operations.  The Access Node Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction
    between components of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT).  The Access Node
    Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of information between the
    NAS and Access Node Complex (ANX) and between the OLT and ONT within an ANX does
    not need to go through distinct element managers but rather uses direct device-to-device
    communication and stays on net.  This allows for performing access-link-related
    operations within those network elements to meet performance objectives.
