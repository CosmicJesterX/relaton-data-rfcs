abstract:
- content: RFC 2916 assigned responsibility for a number of administrative and operational
    details of Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) to the IAB.  It also anticipated that
    ITU would take responsibility for determining the legitimacy and appropriateness
    of applicants for delegation of "country code"-level subdomains of the top-level
    ENUM domain.  Recently, three memos have been prepared for the ITU-T Study Group
    2 (SG2) to explain the background of, and reasoning for, the relevant decisions.  The
    IAB has also supplied a set of procedural instructions to the RIPE NCC for implementation
    of their part of the model.  The content of the three memos is provided in this
    document for the information of the IETF community.
