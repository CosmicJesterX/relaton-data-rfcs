abstract:
- content: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load-balance
    traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress Label Switching Router (LSR)
    cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given Label Switched Path (LSP) unless
    an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it has the capability to process
    ELs, referred to as the Entropy Label Capability (ELC), on that LSP.  In addition,
    it would be useful for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability for reading
    the maximum label stack depth and performing EL-based load-balancing, referred
    to as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD).  This document defines a mechanism
    to signal these two capabilities using OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, and Border Gateway Protocol
    - Link State (BGP-LS).
