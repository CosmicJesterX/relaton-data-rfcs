abstract:
  content: Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where the network
    provides users with named content instead of communication channels between hosts.  This
    document outlines some research directions for ICN with respect to applying ICN
    approaches for coping with natural or human-generated, large-scale disasters.  This
    document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).
