abstract:
  content: SMIng (Structure of Management Information, Next Generation) (RFC3780),
    is a protocol-independent data definition language for management information.  This
    memo defines an SMIng language extension that specifies the mapping of SMIng definitions
    of identities, classes, and their attributes and events to dedicated definitions
    of nodes, scalar objects, tables and columnar objects, and notifications, for
    application to the SNMP management framework.  This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.
