abstract:
  content: This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of an IPv6
    over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) fragment over a route-over
    network.  Forwarding fragments can improve both end-to-end latency and reliability
    as well as reduce the buffer requirements in intermediate nodes; it may be implemented
    using RFC 4944 and Virtual Reassembly Buffers (VRBs).
