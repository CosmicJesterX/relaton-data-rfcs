abstract:
  content: Since the initial revelations of pervasive surveillance in 2013, several
    classes of attacks on Internet communications have been discovered.  In this document,
    we develop a threat model that describes these attacks on Internet confidentiality.  We
    assume an attacker that is interested in undetected, indiscriminate eavesdropping.  The
    threat model is based on published, verified attacks.
