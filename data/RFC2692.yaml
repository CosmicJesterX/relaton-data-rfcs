abstract:
  content: The SPKI Working Group first established a list of things one might want
    to do with certificates (attached at the end of this document), and then summarized
    that list of desires into requirements.  This document presents that summary of
    requirements.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
