abstract:
  content: In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance criteria
    when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE Label Switched Path (LSP).  Such
    performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss or other indications
    such as the conformance to link performance objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic
    load.  This specification describes how a path computation function may use network
    performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF and IS-IS TE metric extensions
    (defined outside the scope of this document) to perform such path selections.
