abstract:
  content: This document specifies the requirements that the OPES (Open Pluggable
    Edge Services) callout protocol must satisfy in order to support the remote execution
    of OPES services.  The requirements are intended to help evaluate possible protocol
    candidates, as well as to guide the development of such protocols.  This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.
