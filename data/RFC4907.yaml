abstract:
- content: A link indication represents information provided by the link layer to
    higher layers regarding the state of the link.  This document describes the role
    of link indications within the Internet architecture.  While the judicious use
    of link indications can provide performance benefits, inappropriate use can degrade
    both robustness and performance.  This document summarizes current proposals,
    describes the architectural issues, and provides examples of appropriate and inappropriate
    uses of link indications.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
