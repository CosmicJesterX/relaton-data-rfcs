abstract:
  content: This document provides a framework and service level requirements for Layer
    1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). This framework is intended to aid in developing
    and standardizing protocols and mechanisms to support interoperable L1VPNs. The
    document examines motivations for L1VPNs, high level (service level) requirements,
    and outlines some of the architectural models that might be used to build L1VPNs.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.
