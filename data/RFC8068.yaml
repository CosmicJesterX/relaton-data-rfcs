abstract:
- content: Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications environments,
    such as call centers and financial trading organizations.  In some of these environments,
    all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer-protection
    reasons.  The recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy
    of a media stream to a recording device.  This document lists call flows with
    metadata snapshots sent from a Session Recording Client (SRC) to a Session Recording
    Server (SRS).
