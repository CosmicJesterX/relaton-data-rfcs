abstract:
- content: This document describes the properties and use of a revised Microsoft Word
    template (.dot) for writing Internet Drafts and RFCs. It replaces the initial
    template described in RFC 3285 to more fully support Word's outline modes and
    to be easier to use. This template can be direct-printed and direct-viewed, where
    either is line-for-line identical with RFC Editor-compliant ASCII output. This
    version obsoletes RFC 3285. The most recent version of this template and post-processing
    scripts are available at http://www.isi.edu/touch/tools. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
