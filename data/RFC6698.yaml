abstract:
- content: Encrypted communication on the Internet often uses Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), which depends on third parties to certify the keys used.  This document
    improves on that situation by enabling the administrators of domain names to specify
    the keys used in that domain's TLS servers.  This requires matching improvements
    in TLS client software, but no change in TLS server software. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
