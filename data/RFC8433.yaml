abstract:
- content: 'The "alert" namespace of Uniform Resource Names (URNs) can be used in
    the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and
    responses to inform a voice over IP (VoIP) telephone (user agent) of the characteristics
    of the call that the user agent has originated or terminated. The user agent must
    resolve the URNs into a signal; that is, it must select the best available signal
    to present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call. RFC 7462 describes
    a non-normative algorithm for signal selection. This document describes a more
    efficient alternative algorithm: a user agent''s designer can, based on the user
    agent''s signals and their meanings, construct a finite state machine (FSM) to
    process the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given
    in the definition of the "alert" URN namespace.'
