abstract:
- content: In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information
    networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network performance information
    (e.g., link propagation delay) is becoming critical to data path selection. This
    document describes common extensions to RFC 3630 "Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions
    to OSPF Version 2" and RFC 5329 "Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF Version
    3" to enable network performance information to be distributed in a scalable fashion.
    The information distributed using OSPF TE Metric Extensions can then be used to
    make path selection decisions based on network performance. Note that this document
    only covers the mechanisms by which network performance information is distributed.
    The mechanisms for measuring network performance information or using that information,
    once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.
