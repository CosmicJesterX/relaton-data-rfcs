abstract:
  content: The multipart/report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) media
    type is a general "family" or "container" type for electronic mail reports of
    any kind. Although this memo defines only the use of the multipart/report media
    type with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit
    if a single media type is used for all kinds of reports. This memo obsoletes "The
    Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative
    Messages", RFC 3462, and marks RFC 3462 and its predecessor as "Historic". [STANDARDS-TRACK]
