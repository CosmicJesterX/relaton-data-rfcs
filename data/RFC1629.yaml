abstract:
  content: This paper provides guidelines for allocating NSAP addresses in the Internet.  The
    guidelines provided in this paper have been the basis for initial deployment of
    CLNP in the Internet, and have proven very valuable both as an aid to scaling
    of CLNP routing, and for address administration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
