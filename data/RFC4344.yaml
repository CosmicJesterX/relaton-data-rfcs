abstract:
  content: Researchers have discovered that the authenticated encryption portion of
    the current SSH Transport Protocol is vulnerable to several attacks. This document
    describes new symmetric encryption methods for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport
    Protocol and gives specific recommendations on how frequently SSH implementations
    should rekey. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
