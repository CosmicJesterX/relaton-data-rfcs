abstract:
- content: Layered Coding Transport (LCT) provides transport level support for reliable
    content delivery and stream delivery protocols.  LCT is specifically designed
    to support protocols using IP multicast, but also provides support to protocols
    that use unicast.  LCT is compatible with congestion control that provides multiple
    rate delivery to receivers and is also compatible with coding techniques that
    provide reliable delivery of content.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
