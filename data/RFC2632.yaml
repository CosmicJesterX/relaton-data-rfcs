abstract:
  content: S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), provides a method
    to send and receive secure MIME messages.  Before using a public key to provide
    security services, the S/MIME agent MUST certify that the public key is valid.  S/MIME
    agents MUST use PKIX certificates to validate public keys as described in the
    Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate and CRL Profile. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
