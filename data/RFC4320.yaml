abstract:
  content: This document describes modifications to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) to address problems that have been identified with the SIP non-INVITE transaction.  These
    modifications reduce the probability of messages losing the race condition inherent
    in the non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic.  They also improve
    the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding.  These changes update
    behavior defined in RFC 3261. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
