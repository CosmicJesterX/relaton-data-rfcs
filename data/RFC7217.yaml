abstract:
  content: This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface Identifiers
    to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), such that an
    IPv6 address configured using this method is stable within each subnet, but the
    corresponding Interface Identifier changes when the host moves from one network
    to another.  This method is meant to be an alternative to generating Interface
    Identifiers based on hardware addresses (e.g., IEEE LAN Media Access Control (MAC)
    addresses), such that the benefits of stable addresses can be achieved without
    sacrificing the security and privacy of users.  The method specified in this document
    applies to all prefixes a host may be employing, including link-local, global,
    and unique-local prefixes (and their corresponding addresses).
