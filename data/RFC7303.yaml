abstract:
  content: This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml, application/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    and application/xml-dtd -- for use in exchanging network entities that are related
    to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/ xml-external-parsed-entity
    as aliases for the respective application/ types.  This specification also standardizes
    the '+xml' suffix for naming media types outside of these five types when those
    media types represent XML MIME entities.
