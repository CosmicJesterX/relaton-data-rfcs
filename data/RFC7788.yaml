abstract:
- content: This document describes the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP), an
    extensible configuration protocol, and a set of requirements for home network
    devices.  HNCP is described as a profile of and extension to the Distributed Node
    Consensus Protocol (DNCP).  HNCP enables discovery of network borders, automated
    configuration of addresses, name resolution, service discovery, and the use of
    any routing protocol that supports routing based on both the source and destination
    address.
