abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is twofold.  First, it describes various alternatives
    for exchanging inter-domain routing information across domain boundaries, where
    one of the peering domain is CIDR-capable and another is not.  Second, it addresses
    the implications of running CIDR- capable inter-domain routing protocols (e.g.,
    BGP-4, IDRP) on intra- domain routing.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
