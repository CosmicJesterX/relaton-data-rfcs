abstract:
  content: This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR)
    block that allows reporting of a post-repair loss count metric for a range of
    RTP applications.  In addition, another metric, repaired loss count, is also introduced
    in this report block for calculating the pre-repair loss count when needed, so
    that the RTP sender or a third-party entity is able to evaluate the effectiveness
    of the repair methods used by the system.
