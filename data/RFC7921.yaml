abstract:
  content: This document describes the IETF architecture for a standard, programmatic
    interface for state transfer in and out of the Internet routing system.  It describes
    the high-level architecture, the building blocks of this high-level architecture,
    and their interfaces, with particular focus on those to be standardized as part
    of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS).
