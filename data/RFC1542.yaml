abstract:
  content: Some aspects of the BOOTP protocol were rather loosely defined in its original
    specification.  In particular, only a general description was provided for the
    behavior of "BOOTP relay agents" (originally called "BOOTP forwarding agents").  The
    client behavior description also suffered in certain ways.  This memo attempts
    to clarify and strengthen the specification in these areas. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
