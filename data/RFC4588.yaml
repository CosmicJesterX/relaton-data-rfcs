abstract:
- content: RTP retransmission is an effective packet loss recovery technique for real-time
    applications with relaxed delay bounds.  This document describes an RTP payload
    format for performing retransmissions.  Retransmitted RTP packets are sent in
    a separate stream from the original RTP stream.  It is assumed that feedback from
    receivers to senders is available.  In particular, it is assumed that Real-time
    Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback as defined in the extended RTP profile
    for RTCP-based feedback (denoted RTP/AVPF) is available in this memo. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
