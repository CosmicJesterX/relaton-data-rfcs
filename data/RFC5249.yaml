abstract:
- content: This memo references three annotated templates for IETF documents that
    contain the definition of MIB modules.  It is intended to reduce the work of the
    editors of such documents, making these documents more uniform and easier to read
    and review, thus furthering the quality of such documents and expediting their
    publication.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
