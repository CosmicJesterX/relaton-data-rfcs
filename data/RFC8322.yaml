abstract:
  content: This document defines a resource-oriented approach for security automation
    information publication, discovery, and sharing.  Using this approach, producers
    may publish, share, and exchange representations of software descriptors, security
    incidents, attack indicators, software vulnerabilities, configuration checklists,
    and other security automation information as web-addressable resources.  Furthermore,
    consumers and other stakeholders may access and search this security information
    as needed, establishing a rapid and on-demand information exchange network for
    restricted internal use or public access repositories.  This specification extends
    the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format to transport and share
    security automation resource representations.
