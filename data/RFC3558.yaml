abstract:
- content: This document describes the RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable Rate
    Codec (EVRC) Speech and Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV) Speech.  Two sub-formats
    are specified for different application scenarios.  A bundled/interleaved format
    is included to reduce the effect of packet loss on speech quality and amortize
    the overhead of the RTP header over more than one speech frame.  A non-bundled
    format is also supported for conversational applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
