abstract:
  content: An ad hoc middleware workshop was held at the International Center for
    Advanced Internet Research in December 1998.  The need for a more organized framework
    for middleware R&D was recognized, and a list of specific topics needing further
    work was identified.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
