abstract:
  content: This document specifies the Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) protocol for IPv6
    networks, a data-forwarding mechanism that can increase reliability of data delivery
    in networks with dynamic topology and/or lossy links.  The protocol operates entirely
    on the forwarding plane but may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards
    data packets using a mechanism similar to a "depth-first search" for the destination
    of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of failures to deliver a packet
    or loops.  This document specifies the DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as
    specified in RFC 2460) and for "mesh-under" Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (LoWPANs), as specified in RFC 4944.  The design of DFF assumes that the underlying
    link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered
    to the Next Hop or not.  It is applicable for networks with little traffic and
    is used for unicast transmissions only.
