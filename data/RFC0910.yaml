abstract:
- content: This memo is a report on a meeting about the experimental multimedia mail
    system (and in a sense a status report on that experiment).  The meeting was held
    at Bolt Beranek and Newman on 23-24 July 1984 to discuss recent progress by groups
    who are building multimedia mail systems and to discuss a variety of issues related
    to the further development of multimedia systems.  Representatives were present
    from BBN, ISI, SRI and Linkabit.
