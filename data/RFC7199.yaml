abstract:
  content: Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning an
    Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's location.  These protocols
    lack a mechanism for the target host to inspect or set the privacy rules that
    are applied to the URIs they distribute.  This document extends the current location
    configuration protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are
    applied to a URI so that the host can view or set these rules.
