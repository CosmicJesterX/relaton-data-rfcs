abstract:
  content: An alternative to the default Designated Forwarder (DF) selection algorithm
    in Ethernet VPNs (EVPNs) is defined.  The DF is the Provider Edge (PE) router
    responsible for sending Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic
    to a multihomed Customer Edge (CE) device on a given VLAN on a particular Ethernet
    Segment (ES).  In addition, the ability to influence the DF election result for
    a VLAN based on the state of the associated Attachment Circuit (AC) is specified.  This
    document clarifies the DF election Finite State Machine in EVPN services.  Therefore,
    it updates the EVPN specification (RFC 7432).
