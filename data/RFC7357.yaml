abstract:
- content: The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides least-cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies. TRILL supports multipathing
    of both unicast and multicast traffic. Devices that implement the TRILL protocol
    are called TRILL switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges). ESADI (End Station Address
    Distribution Information) is an optional protocol by which a TRILL switch can
    communicate, in a Data Label (VLAN or fine-grained label) scoped way, end station
    address and reachability information to TRILL switches participating in ESADI
    for the relevant Data Label. This document updates RFC 6325, specifically the
    documentation of the ESADI protocol, and is not backwards compatible.
