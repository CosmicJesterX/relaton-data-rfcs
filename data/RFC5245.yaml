abstract:
  content: This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT)
    traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with the offer/answer
    model.  This protocol is called Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  ICE
    makes use of the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension,
    Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any protocol utilizing the
    offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
