abstract:
  content: 'This document defines TCP''s four intertwined congestion control algorithms:
    slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.  In addition,
    the document specifies how TCP should begin transmission after a relatively long
    idle period, as well as discussing various acknowledgment generation methods.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 2581. [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
