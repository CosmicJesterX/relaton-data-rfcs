abstract:
- content: The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0" includes the specification for a
    Basic Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered to be a secure
    method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the
    network as clear text.  A specification for a different authentication scheme
    is needed to address this severe limitation.  This document provides specification
    for such a scheme, referred to as "Digest Access Authentication". [STANDARDS-TRACK]
