abstract:
  content: The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring data.  While
    it evolved from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) -- a markup language
    primarily focused on structuring documents -- XML has evolved to be a widely-used
    mechanism for representing structured data.  There are a wide variety of Internet
    protocols being developed; many have need for a representation for structured
    data relevant to their application.  There has been much interest in the use of
    XML as a representation method.  This document describes basic XML concepts, analyzes
    various alternatives in the use of XML, and provides guidelines for the use of
    XML within IETF standards-track protocols.  This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.
