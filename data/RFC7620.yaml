abstract:
  content: This document describes a set of scenarios in which complications when
    identifying which policy to apply for a host are encountered. This problem is
    abstracted as "host identification". Describing these scenarios allows commonalities
    between scenarios to be identified, which is helpful during the solution design
    phase. This document does not include any solution-specific discussions.
