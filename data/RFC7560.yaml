abstract:
- content: Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network nodes
    can mark IP packets, instead of dropping them, to indicate congestion to the endpoints.  An
    ECN-capable receiver will feed this information back to the sender.  ECN is specified
    for TCP in such a way that it can only feed back one congestion signal per Round-Trip
    Time (RTT).  In contrast, ECN for other transport protocols, such as RTP/UDP and
    SCTP, is specified with more accurate ECN feedback.  Recent new TCP mechanisms
    (like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data Center TCP (DCTCP)) need more accurate
    ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This
    document specifies requirements for an update to the TCP protocol to provide more
    accurate ECN feedback.
