abstract:
- content: This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher as well as the use of
    the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms and as a "combined
    mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm. This
    document does not introduce any new crypto, but is meant to serve as a stable
    reference and an implementation guide. It is a product of the Crypto Forum Research
    Group (CFRG).
