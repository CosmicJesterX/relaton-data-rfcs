abstract:
- content: This RFC proposed a new service for the ARPA-Internet community and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The network mail path service fills
    the current need of people to determine mailbox addresses for hosts that are not
    part of the ARPA-Internet but can be reached by one or more relay hosts that have
    Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP) mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail, etc.  Anyone
    can use the service if they have TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with a mail path
    server.
