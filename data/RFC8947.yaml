abstract:
  content: In certain environments, e.g., large-scale virtualization deployments,
    new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such devices may have their link-layer
    addresses assigned in an automated fashion.  With sufficient scale, the likelihood
    of a collision using random assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.  Therefore,
    an allocation mechanism is required.  This document proposes an extension to DHCPv6
    that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments where preassigned
    link-layer address assignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or
    are unnecessary.
