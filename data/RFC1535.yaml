abstract:
- content: This document discusses a flaw in some of the currently distributed name
    resolver clients.  The flaw exposes a security weakness related to the search
    heuristic invoked by these same resolvers when users provide a partial domain
    name, and which is easy to exploit.  This document points out the flaw, a case
    in point, and a solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It
    does not specify an Internet standard.
