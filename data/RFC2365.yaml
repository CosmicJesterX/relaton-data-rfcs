abstract:
- content: This document defines the "administratively scoped IPv4 multicast space"
    to be the range 239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.  In addition, it describes a simple
    set of semantics for the implementation of Administratively Scoped IP Multicast.  Finally,
    it provides a mapping between the IPv6 multicast address classes [RFC1884] and
    IPv4 multicast address classes.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current
    Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.
