abstract:
- content: This document introduces a hub and spoke multipoint (HSMP) Label Switched
    Path (LSP), which allows traffic from root to leaf through point-to-multipoint
    (P2MP) LSPs and also leaf to root along the reverse path.  That means traffic
    entering the HSMP LSP from the application/customer at the root node travels downstream
    to each leaf node, exactly as if it were traveling downstream along a P2MP LSP
    to each leaf node.  Upstream traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels
    upstream along the tree to the root, as if it were unicast to the root.  Direct
    communication among the leaf nodes is not allowed.
