abstract:
- content: This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB)
    whose traffic may be "starved" (although starvation is not strictly required)
    in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's "best-effort"
    or "normal Internet traffic" model, where prolonged starvation indicates network
    problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a "lower"
    priority than the normal "best-effort" Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called
    "Lower Effort" (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit
    the effect of its traffic on "best-effort"/"normal" or all other Internet traffic.  This
    document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's
    use to any particular type of traffic.
