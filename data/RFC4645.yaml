abstract:
  content: This memo defined the initial contents of the IANA Language Subtag Registry
    for use in forming tags for the identification of languages.  Since the contents
    of this memo only served as a starting point for the registry, its actual contents
    have been removed before publication to avoid confusion.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
