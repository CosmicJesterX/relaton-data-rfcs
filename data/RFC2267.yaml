abstract:
  content: This paper discusses a simple, effective, and straightforward method for
    using ingress traffic filtering to prohibit DoS attacks which use forged IP addresses
    to be propagated from 'behind' an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) aggregation
    point.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not
    specify an Internet standard of any kind.
