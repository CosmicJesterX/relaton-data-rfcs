abstract:
  content: The Handle System is a general-purpose global name service that allows
    secured name resolution and administration over the public Internet.  This document
    describes the protocol used for client software to access the Handle System for
    both handle resolution and administration.  The protocol specifies the procedure
    for a client software to locate the responsible handle server of any given handle.  It
    also defines the messages exchanged between the client and server for any handle
    operation.
