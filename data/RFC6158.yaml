- content: This document provides guidelines for the design of attributes used by
    the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol.  It is expected

    attribute specifications, within the IETF as well as other Standards Development
    Organizations (SDOs).  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.
