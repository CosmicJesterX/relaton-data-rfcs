abstract:
  content: This document defines basic classes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) used
    in Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES).  The basic LFB classes
    are defined according to the ForCES Forwarding Element (FE) model and ForCES protocol
    specifications; they are scoped to meet requirements of typical router functions
    and are considered the basic LFB library for ForCES.  The library includes the
    descriptions of the LFBs and the XML definitions.
