abstract:
- content: This memo suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access
    mail from a discussion group server, as an extension to an earlier memo which
    dealt with dynamically accessing mail from a mailbox server using the Post Office
    Protocol - Version 3 (POP3).  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the Internet
    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  All of the
    extensions described in this memo to the POP3 are OPTIONAL.
