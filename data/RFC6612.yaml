abstract:
  content: The use of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) in the same
    network requires some care.  This document discusses scenarios where such mixed
    usage is appropriate and points out the need for interaction between the two mechanisms.  Solutions
    and recommendations to enable these scenarios are also described.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
