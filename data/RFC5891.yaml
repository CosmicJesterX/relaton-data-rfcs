abstract:
  content: This document is the revised protocol definition for Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs).  The rationale for changes, the relationship to the older
    specification, and important terminology are provided in other documents.  This
    document specifies the protocol mechanism, called Internationalized Domain Names
    in Applications (IDNA), for registering and looking up IDNs in a way that does
    not require changes to the DNS itself.  IDNA is only meant for processing domain
    names, not free text. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
