abstract:
- content: The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide protocols
    to facilitate interoperability across disparate DDoS Mitigation solutions.  This
    document presents sample use cases that describe the interactions expected between
    the DOTS components as well as DOTS messaging exchanges.  These use cases are
    meant to identify the interacting DOTS components, how they collaborate, and what
    the typical information to be exchanged is.
