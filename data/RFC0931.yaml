abstract:
- content: This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is the second
    draft of this proposal (superseding RFC-912) and incorporates a more formal description
    of the syntax for the request and response dialog, as well as a change to specify
    the type of user identification returned.
