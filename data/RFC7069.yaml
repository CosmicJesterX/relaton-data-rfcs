abstract:
  content: Content distribution applications, such as those employing peer-to-peer
    (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and make up a large portion
    of the traffic in many networks.  Often, however, content distribution applications
    use network resources inefficiently.  One way to improve efficiency is to introduce
    storage capabilities within the network and enable cooperation between end-host
    and in-network content distribution mechanisms.  This is the capability provided
    by a DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system, which is introduced in
    this document.  DECADE enables applications to take advantage of in-network storage
    when distributing data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end resources.  This
    document presents the underlying principles and key functionalities of such a
    system and illustrates operation through a set of examples.
