abstract:
- content: This document specifies an architecture and a gateway-to-gateway protocol
    for the implementation of fibre channel fabric functionality over an IP network.  This
    functionality is provided through TCP protocols for fibre channel frame transport
    and the distributed fabric services specified by the fibre channel standards.  The
    architecture enables internetworking of fibre channel devices through gateway-accessed
    regions with the fault isolation properties of autonomous systems and the scalability
    of the IP network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
