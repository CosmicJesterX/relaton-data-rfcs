abstract:
- content: This document specifies extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    to support the creation of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for Maximally Redundant
    Trees (MRTs). A prime use of MRTs is for unicast and multicast IP/LDP Fast Reroute,
    which we will refer to as "MRT-FRR". The sole protocol extension to LDP is simply
    the ability to advertise an MRT Capability. This document describes that extension
    and the associated behavior expected for Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and Label
    Edge Routers (LERs) advertising the MRT Capability. MRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology
    extensions, so three multi-topology IDs have been allocated from the MPLS MT-ID
    space.
