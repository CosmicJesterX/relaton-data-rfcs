abstract:
- content: This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
    use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular,
    it defines objects for managing user identities and the names, addresses, and
    credentials required manage access control, for use with various protocols.  This
    document was motivated by the need for the configuration of authorized user identities
    for the iSCSI protocol, but has been extended to be useful for other protocols
    that have similar requirements.  It is important to note that this MIB module
    provides only the set of identities to be used within access lists; it is the
    responsibility of other MIB modules making use of this one to tie them to their
    own access lists or other authorization control methods. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
