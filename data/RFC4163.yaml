abstract:
- content: This document contains requirements on the TCP/IP header compression scheme
    (profile) to be developed by the RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Working Group.  The
    document discusses the scope of TCP compression, performance considerations, assumptions
    about the surrounding environment, as well as Intellectual Property Rights concerns.  The
    structure of this document is inherited from RFC 3096, which defines IP/UDP/RTP
    requirements for ROHC.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
