abstract:
- content: Deployment of BGP origin validation that is based on the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has many operational considerations.  This document
    attempts to collect and present those that are most critical.  It is expected
    to evolve as RPKI-based origin validation continues to be deployed and the dynamics
    are better understood.
