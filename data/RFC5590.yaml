abstract:
  content: This document defines a Transport Subsystem, extending the Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in RFC 3411.  This document defines
    a subsystem to contain Transport Models that is comparable to other subsystems
    in the RFC 3411 architecture.  As work is being done to expand the transports
    to include secure transports, such as the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol and Transport
    Layer Security (TLS), using a subsystem will enable consistent design and modularity
    of such Transport Models.  This document identifies and describes some key aspects
    that need to be considered for any Transport Model for SNMP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
