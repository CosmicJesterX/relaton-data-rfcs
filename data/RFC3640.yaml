abstract:
- content: The Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) Committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG11)
    is a working group in ISO that produced the MPEG-4 standard.  MPEG defines tools
    to compress content such as audio-visual information into elementary streams.  This
    specification defines a simple, but generic RTP payload format for transport of
    any non-multiplexed MPEG-4 elementary stream.
