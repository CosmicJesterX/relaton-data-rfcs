abstract:
  content: This document describes known incompatibilities between Network Address
    Translation (NAT) and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing them.  Perhaps
    the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private networking capabilities.  One
    very popular use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) is to provide telecommuter
    access to the corporate Intranet.  Today, NATs are widely deployed in home gateways,
    as well as in other locations likely to be used by telecommuters, such as hotels.  The
    result is that IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major barrier in the
    deployment of IPsec in one of its principal uses.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.
