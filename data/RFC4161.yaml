abstract:
  content: To allow connectivity between the general switched telephone network facsimile
    service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax service (i-fax), an "Internet
    Fax Gateway" is required. This document provides guidelines for the optional functionality
    of Internet Fax Gateways. In this context, an "offramp gateway" provides facsimile
    data transmission from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an "onramp gateway" provides
    data transmission from GSTN fax to i-fax. The recommendations in this document
    apply to the integrated service including Internet Fax terminals, computers with
    i-fax software on the Internet, and GSTN fax terminals on the GSTN. This document
    supplements the recommendation for minimal features of an Internet Fax Gateway.
    In particular, it covers techniques for dropping duplicated fax messages, automatic
    fax re-transmission, error, return notice, and log handling, and possible authorization
    methods by DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) for onramp gateways. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
