abstract:
- content: 'In certain networking topologies, it may be advantageous to maintain associations
    between endpoints and key transit points to support an instance of a service.
    Such associations are known as Calls. A Call does not provide the actual connectivity
    for transmitting user traffic, but only builds a relationship by which subsequent
    Connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such Connections are known
    as Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document specifies how GMPLS Resource Reservation
    Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling may be used and extended to
    support Calls. These mechanisms provide full and logical Call/Connection separation.
    The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any environment (including
    multi-area), and for any type of interface: packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed,
    lambda, or fiber switching. [STANDARDS-TRACK]'
