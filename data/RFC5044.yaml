abstract:
- content: Marker PDU Aligned Framing (MPA) is designed to work as an "adaptation
    layer" between TCP and the Direct Data Placement protocol (DDP) as described in
    RFC 5041.  It preserves the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP, while adding the
    preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries that DDP requires.  MPA
    is fully compliant with applicable TCP RFCs and can be utilized with existing
    TCP implementations.  MPA also supports integrated implementations that combine
    TCP, MPA and DDP to reduce buffering requirements in the implementation and improve
    performance at the system level. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
