abstract:
  content: This document specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet Attachment
    Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance
    with the Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architecture to realize an end-to-end
    emulated Ethernet service.  It standardizes the behavior of Provider Edges (PEs)
    with respect to Ethernet PW and AC defects.
