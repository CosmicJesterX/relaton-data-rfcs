abstract:
  content: Broadcasting is a technology that has been largely discarded in favor of
    technologies like multicast.  This document builds on RFC 919 and describes a
    more efficient routing mechanism for broadcast packets destined for multiple Local
    Area Networks (LANs) or Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) using an alternative
    link layer.  It significantly reduces congestion on network equipment and does
    not require additional physical infrastructure investment.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
