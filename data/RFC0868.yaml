abstract:
  content: This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on
    the ARPA Internet that choose to implement a Time Protocol are expected to adopt
    and implement this standard.  This protocol provides a site-independent, machine
    readable date and time.  The Time service sends back to the originating source
    the time in seconds since midnight on January first 1900.
