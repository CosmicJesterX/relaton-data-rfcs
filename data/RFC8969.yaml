abstract:
  content: Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and networks.
    Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration information for network and
    service components, and state information that will be monitored and tracked.
    Data models can be used during the service and network management life cycle (e.g.,
    service instantiation, service provisioning, service optimization, service monitoring,
    service diagnosing, and service assurance). Data models are also instrumental
    in the automation of network management, and they can provide closed-loop control
    for adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance. This
    document describes a framework for service and network management automation that
    takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This framework is drawn from a
    network operator perspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; thus,
    it can accommodate YANG modules that are developed outside the IETF.
