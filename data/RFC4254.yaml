abstract:
- content: Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure
    network services over an insecure network. This document describes the SSH Connection
    Protocol. It provides interactive login sessions, remote execution of commands,
    forwarded TCP/IP connections, and forwarded X11 connections. All of these channels
    are multiplexed into a single encrypted tunnel. The SSH Connection Protocol has
    been designed to run on top of the SSH transport layer and user authentication
    protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
