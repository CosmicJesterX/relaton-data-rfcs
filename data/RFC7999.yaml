abstract:
- content: This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) community for destination-based blackholing in IP networks.  This well-known
    advisory transitive BGP community named "BLACKHOLE" allows an origin Autonomous
    System (AS) to specify that a neighboring network should discard any traffic destined
    towards the tagged IP prefix.
