abstract:
- content: This memorandum defines the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) version
    2.0, which obsoletes RTSP version 1.0 defined in RFC 2326. RTSP is an application-layer
    protocol for the setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time properties.
    RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery
    of real-time data, such as audio and video. Sources of data can include both live
    data feeds and stored clips. This protocol is intended to control multiple data
    delivery sessions; provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP,
    multicast UDP, and TCP; and provide a means for choosing delivery mechanisms based
    upon RTP (RFC 3550).
