abstract:
  content: The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is used to describe the parameters
    of media streams used in multimedia sessions.  When a session requires multiple
    ports, SDP assumes that these ports have consecutive numbers.  However, when the
    session crosses a network address translation device that also uses port mapping,
    the ordering of ports can be destroyed by the translation.  To handle this, we
    propose an extension attribute to SDP.
