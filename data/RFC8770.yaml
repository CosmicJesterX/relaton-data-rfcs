abstract:
  content: The Open Shortest Path First Version 2 (OSPFv2) protocol does not have
    a mechanism for a node to repel transit traffic if it is on the shortest path.  This
    document defines a bit called the Host-bit (H-bit).  This bit enables a router
    to advertise that it is a non-transit router.  This document also describes the
    changes needed to support the H-bit in the domain.  In addition, this document
    updates RFC 6987 to advertise Type 2 External and Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) Link
    State Advertisements (LSAs) (RFC 3101) with a high cost in order to repel traffic
    effectively.
