abstract:
  content: This document describes lower layer guidelines for robust header compression
    (ROHC) and the requirements ROHC puts on lower layers.  The purpose of this document
    is to support the incorporation of robust header compression algorithms, as specified
    in the ROHC working group, into different systems such as those specified by Third
    Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), 3GPP Project 2 (3GPP2), European Technical
    Standards Institute (ETSI), etc.  This document covers only lower layer guidelines
    for compression of RTP/UDP/IP and UDP/IP headers as specified in [RFC3095].  Both
    general guidelines and guidelines specific for cellular systems are discussed
    in this document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
