  content: This document has been reviewed by the Federal Engineering Task Force (FEPG)
    on behalf of the Federal Networking Council (FNC), the co-chairs of the International
    Engineering Planning Group (IEPG), and the Reseaux IP Europeens (RIPE).  There
    was general consensus by those groups to support the recommendations proposed
    in this document for management of the IP address space.  This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.  This RFC
    suggests an extension to the IP protocol to solve the shortage of IP address problem,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.  This
    memo defines the various criteria to be used when designing Autonomous System
    Border Routers (ASBR) that will run BGP with other ASBRs external to the AS and
    OSPF as its IGP. [STANDARDS-TRACK] 1363 Partridge Spt 92 A Proposed Flow Specification
    The flow specification defined in this memo is intended for information and possible
    experimentation (i.e., experimental use by consenting routers and applications
    only).  This RFC is a product of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an
    Internet standard.
