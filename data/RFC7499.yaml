abstract:
  content: The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is limited
    to a total packet size of 4096 bytes.  Provisions exist for fragmenting large
    amounts of authentication data across multiple packets, via Access-Challenge packets.  No
    similar provisions exist for fragmenting large amounts of authorization data.  This
    document specifies how existing RADIUS mechanisms can be leveraged to provide
    that functionality.  These mechanisms are largely compatible with existing implementations,
    and they are designed to be invisible to proxies and "fail-safe" to legacy RADIUS
    Clients and Servers.
