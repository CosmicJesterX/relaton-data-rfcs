abstract:
  content: The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a very simple TRIVIAL protocol
    that has been in use on the Internet for quite a long time.  While this document
    discourages its continued use, largely due to security concerns, we do define
    a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme, as well as discuss the protocol's
    applicability.
