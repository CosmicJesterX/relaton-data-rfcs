abstract:
  content: 'The U.S.  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
    solicited a request from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
    (ICANN) to propose how the NTIA should end its oversight of the Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA) functions.  After broad consultations, ICANN in turn
    created the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group.  That group solicited
    proposals for the three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and protocol parameters.  This
    document contains the IETF response to that solicitation for protocol parameters.  It
    was included in an aggregate response to the NTIA alongside those for names and
    numbering resources that are being developed by their respective operational communities.  A
    reference to that response may be found in the introduction, and additional correspondence
    is included in the Appendix.'
