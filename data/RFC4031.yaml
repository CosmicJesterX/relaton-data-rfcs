abstract:
- content: This document provides requirements for Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks
    (L3VPNs).  It identifies requirements applicable to a number of individual approaches
    that a Service Provider may use to provision a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.  This
    document expresses a service provider perspective, based upon past experience
    with IP-based service offerings and the ever-evolving needs of the customers of
    such services.  Toward this end, it first defines terminology and states general
    requirements.  Detailed requirements are expressed from a customer perspective
    as well as that of a service provider.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
