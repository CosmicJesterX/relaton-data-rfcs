abstract:
  content: This document describes the link selection sub-option of the relay- agent-information
    option for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4).  The giaddr specifies
    an IP address which determines both a subnet, and thereby a link on which a Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client resides as well as an IP address that
    can be used to communicate with the relay agent.  The subnet-selection option
    allows the functions of the giaddr to be split so that when one entity is performing
    as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet/link from which to allocate an IP address,
    which is different from the IP address with which it desires to communicate with
    the DHCP server.  Analogous situations exist where the relay agent needs to specify
    the subnet/link on which a DHCP client resides, which is different from an IP
    address that can be used to communicate with the relay agent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
