abstract:
  content: This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol,
    which serves as a means for transmitting Traffic Flow information over the network.  In
    order to transmit Traffic Flow information from an Exporting Process to a Collecting
    Process, a common representation of flow data and a standard means of communicating
    them are required.  This document describes how the IPFIX Data and Template Records
    are carried over a number of transport protocols from an IPFIX Exporting Process
    to an IPFIX Collecting Process.  This document obsoletes RFC 5101.
