abstract:
- content: ICAP, the Internet Content Adaption Protocol, is a protocol aimed at providing
    simple object-based content vectoring for HTTP services.  ICAP is, in essence,
    a lightweight protocol for executing a "remote procedure call" on HTTP messages.  It
    allows ICAP clients to pass HTTP messages to ICAP servers for some sort of transformation
    or other processing ("adaptation").  The server executes its transformation service
    on messages and sends back responses to the client, usually with modified messages.  Typically,
    the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or HTTP responses.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.
