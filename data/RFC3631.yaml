abstract:
  content: Security must be built into Internet Protocols for those protocols to offer
    their services securely.  Many security problems can be traced to improper implementations.  However,
    even a proper implementation will have security problems if the fundamental protocol
    is itself exploitable.  Exactly how security should be implemented in a protocol
    will vary, because of the structure of the protocol itself.  However, there are
    many protocols for which standard Internet security mechanisms, already developed,
    may be applicable.  The precise one that is appropriate in any given situation
    can vary.  We review a number of different choices, explaining the properties
    of each.
