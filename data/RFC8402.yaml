abstract:
  content: Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment
    can represent any instruction, topological or service based. A segment can have
    a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR provides a mechanism
    that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining
    per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain. SR can be directly
    applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment
    is encoded as an MPLS label. An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack
    of labels. The segment to process is on the top of the stack. Upon completion
    of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack. SR can be applied to
    the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header. A segment is encoded
    as an IPv6 address. An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list
    of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the
    Destination Address (DA) of the packet. The next active segment is indicated by
    a pointer in the new routing header.
