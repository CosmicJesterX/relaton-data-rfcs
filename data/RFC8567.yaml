abstract:
  content: Maintaining high Quality of Experience (QoE) increasingly requires end-to-end,
    holistic network management, including managed Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).
    Because customer management is a shared global responsibility, the Domain Name
    System (DNS) provides an ideal existing infrastructure for maintaining authoritative
    customer information that must be readily, reliably, and publicly accessible.
    This document describes four new DNS resource record types for encoding customer
    information in the DNS. These records are intended to better facilitate high customer
    QoE via inter-provider cooperation and management of customer data.
