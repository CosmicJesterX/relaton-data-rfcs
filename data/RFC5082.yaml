abstract:
  content: The use of a packet's Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to
    verify whether the packet was originated by an adjacent node on a connected link
    has been used in many recent protocols.  This document generalizes this technique.  This
    document obsoletes Experimental RFC 3682. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
