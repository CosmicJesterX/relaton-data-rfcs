abstract:
  content: Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient and
    reliable flooding of information to its peers; however, the current flooding scopes
    are limited to either area scope or domain scope. There are existing use cases
    where support of other flooding scopes is desirable. This document defines new
    Protocol Data Units (PDUs) that provide support for new flooding scopes as well
    as additional space for advertising information targeted for the currently supported
    flooding scopes. This document also defines extended Type-Length-Values (TLVs)
    and sub-TLVs that are encoded using 16-bit fields for Type and Length. The protocol
    extensions defined in this document are not backwards compatible with existing
    implementations and so must be deployed with care.
