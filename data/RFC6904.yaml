abstract:
  content: The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides authentication,
    but not encryption, of the headers of Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets.
    However, RTP header extensions may carry sensitive information for which participants
    in multimedia sessions want confidentiality. This document provides a mechanism,
    extending the mechanisms of SRTP, to selectively encrypt RTP header extensions
    in SRTP. This document updates RFC 3711, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
    specification, to require that all future SRTP encryption transforms specify how
    RTP header extensions are to be encrypted.
