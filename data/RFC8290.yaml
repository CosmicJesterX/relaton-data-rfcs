abstract:
- content: This memo presents the FQ-CoDel hybrid packet scheduler and Active Queue
    Management (AQM) algorithm, a powerful tool for fighting bufferbloat and reducing
    latency. FQ-CoDel mixes packets from multiple flows and reduces the impact of
    head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic. It provides isolation for low-rate
    traffic such as DNS, web, and videoconferencing traffic. It improves utilisation
    across the networking fabric, especially for bidirectional traffic, by keeping
    queue lengths short, and it can be implemented in a memory- and CPU-efficient
    fashion across a wide range of hardware.
