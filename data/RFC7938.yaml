abstract:
- content: Some network operators build and operate data centers that support over
    one hundred thousand servers.  In this document, such data centers are referred
    to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures.  Environments
    of this scale have a unique set of network requirements with an emphasis on operational
    simplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes operational experience
    in designing and operating large-scale data centers using BGP as the only routing
    protocol.  The intent is to report on a proven and stable routing design that
    could be leveraged by others in the industry.
