abstract:
  content: The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms
    for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response
    to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests. Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful
    control of MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. The auto-bandwidth
    feature allows automatic and dynamic adjustment of the TE LSP bandwidth reservation
    based on the volume of traffic flowing through the LSP. This document describes
    PCEP extensions for auto-bandwidth adjustment when employing an active stateful
    PCE for both PCE-initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs.
