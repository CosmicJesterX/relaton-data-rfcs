abstract:
  content: This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard
    ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2, both also
    known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and developed by the Joint Collaborative
    Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization
    of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload
    as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore,
    it supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single stream as well as
    multiple RTP streams.  When multiple RTP streams are used, a single transport
    or multiple transports may be utilized.  The payload format has wide applicability
    in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality
    video, among others.
