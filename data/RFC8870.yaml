abstract:
  content: Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to DTLS (Datagram Transport
    Layer Security) and the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that provides
    for the secure transport of SRTP master keys, rollover counters, and other information
    within SRTP.  This facility enables SRTP for decentralized conferences by distributing
    a common key to all of the conference endpoints.
