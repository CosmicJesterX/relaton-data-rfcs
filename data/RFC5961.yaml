abstract:
- content: TCP has historically been considered to be protected against spoofed off-path
    packet injection attacks by relying on the fact that it is difficult to guess
    the 4-tuple (the source and destination IP addresses and the source and destination
    ports) in combination with the 32-bit sequence number(s).  A combination of increasing
    window sizes and applications using longer-term connections (e.g., H-323 or Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP) [STANDARDS-TRACK]
