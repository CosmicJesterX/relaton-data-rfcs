abstract:
- content: This document explains the terminology and concepts used in OSPF benchmarking.  Although
    some of these terms may be defined elsewhere (and we will refer the reader to
    those definitions in some cases) we include discussions concerning these terms,
    as they relate specifically to the tasks involved in benchmarking the OSPF protocol.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
