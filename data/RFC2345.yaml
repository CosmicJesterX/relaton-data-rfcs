abstract:
- content: This document proposes a company name to URL mapping service based on the
    oldest and least complex of Internet directory protocols, whois, in order to explore
    whether an extremely simple and widely-deployed protocol can succeed where more
    complex and powerful options have failed or been excessively delayed.  This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.  It does not specify
    an Internet standard of any kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested.
