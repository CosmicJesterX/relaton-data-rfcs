abstract:
- content: This document presents a security threat analysis for the Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPLs).  The development builds upon previous
    work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints
    specific to low-power and lossy networks.  A systematic approach is used in defining
    and evaluating the security threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application
    specific and are addressed in relevant applicability statements.
