abstract:
- content: This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by Secure/Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v4.0 agents.  S/MIME provides a method to send
    and receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME
    agent processing.  S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in RFC 5280
    ("Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation
    List (CRL) Profile").  S/MIME agents must meet the certificate-processing requirements
    in this document as well as those in RFC 5280.  This document obsoletes RFC 5750.
