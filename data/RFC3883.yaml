abstract:
- content: OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.  OSPF
    behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the amount
    of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the Hello
    suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to go down when
    no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also introduces
    a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over
    such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called "neighbor probing" to
    address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
