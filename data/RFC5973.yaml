abstract:
  content: This memo defines the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for Network
    Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls.  This NSLP allows hosts to signal on
    the data path for NATs and firewalls to be configured according to the needs of
    the application data flows.  For instance, it enables hosts behind NATs to obtain
    a publicly reachable address and hosts behind firewalls to receive data traffic.  The
    overall architecture is given by the framework and requirements defined by the
    Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group.  The network scenarios, the protocol
    itself, and examples for path-coupled signaling are given in this memo.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
