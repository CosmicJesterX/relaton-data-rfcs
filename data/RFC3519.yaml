abstract:
  content: Mobile IP's datagram tunnelling is incompatible with Network Address Translation
    (NAT).  This document presents extensions to the Mobile IP protocol and a tunnelling
    method which permits mobile nodes using Mobile IP to operate in private address
    networks which are separated from the public internet by NAT devices.  The NAT
    traversal is based on using the Mobile IP Home Agent UDP port for encapsulated
    data traffic. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
