abstract:
  content: This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol (LDAP) to allow the client to read the target entry of an update operation.  The
    client may request to read the entry before and/or after the modifications are
    applied.  These reads are done as an atomic part of the update operation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
