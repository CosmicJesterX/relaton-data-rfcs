abstract:
  content: This memo describes a set of practices intended to enable an authoritative
    name server operator to provide access to a single named server in multiple locations.  The
    primary motivation for the development and deployment of these practices is to
    increase the distribution of Domain Name System (DNS) servers to previously under-
    served areas of the network topology and to reduce the latency for DNS query responses
    in those areas.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
