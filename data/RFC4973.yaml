abstract:
  content: This document defines OSPF-xTE, an experimental traffic engineering (TE)
    extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF.  OSPF-xTE defines new TE Link
    State Advertisements (LSAs) to disseminate TE metrics within an autonomous System
    (AS), which may consist of multiple areas.  When an AS consists of TE and non-TE
    nodes, OSPF-xTE ensures that non-TE nodes in the AS are unaffected by the TE LSAs.  OSPF-xTE
    generates a stand-alone TE Link State Database (TE-LSDB), distinct from the native
    OSPF LSDB, for computation of TE circuit paths.  OSPF-xTE is versatile and extendible
    to non-packet networks such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Time Division
    Multiplexing (TDM) and optical networks.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
