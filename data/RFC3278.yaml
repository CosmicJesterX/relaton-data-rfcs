abstract:
- content: This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) public-key
    algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The ECC algorithms support
    the creation of digital signatures and the exchange of keys to encrypt or authenticate
    content.  The definition of the algorithm processing is based on the ANSI X9.62
    standard, developed by the ANSI X9F1 working group, the IEEE 1363 standard, and
    the SEC 1 standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
