abstract:
- content: Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow networks to be set up in
    such a way that traffic is distributed optimally and centrally deployed anchors
    are not relied upon to provide IP mobility support. There are many different approaches
    to address Distributed Mobility Management -- for example, extending network-based
    mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based mobility protocols
    (like Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach and
    proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which mobility sessions are
    anchored at the last IP hop router (called the mobility anchor and access router).
    The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router that is also
    able to operate as a local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway on a per-prefix
    basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively support
    the simultaneous anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.
