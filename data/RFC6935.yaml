abstract:
  content: This document updates the IPv6 specification (RFC 2460) to improve performance
    when a tunnel protocol uses UDP with IPv6 to tunnel packets.  The performance
    improvement is obtained by relaxing the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement for tunnel
    protocols whose header information is protected on the "inner" packet being carried.  Relaxing
    this requirement removes the overhead associated with the computation of UDP checksums
    on IPv6 packets that carry the tunnel protocol packets.  This specification describes
    how the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement can be relaxed when the encapsulated packet
    itself contains a checksum.  It also describes the limitations and risks of this
    approach and discusses the restrictions on the use of this method.
