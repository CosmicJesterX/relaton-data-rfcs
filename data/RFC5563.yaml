abstract:
  content: Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables an IPv4 device
    to move among networks while maintaining its IP address.  The mobile device has
    the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to the routing anchor,
    known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability
    due to various reasons.  This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a
    scheme based on having the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to
    provide mobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device.  This
    document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as specified in the
    WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be adopted in 3GPP2.  This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.
