abstract:
  content: The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) specification (RFC
    6698) describes how to use TLSA resource records secured by DNSSEC (RFC 4033)
    to associate a server's connection endpoint with its Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) certificate (thus enabling administrators of domain names to specify the
    keys used in that domain's TLS servers).  However, application protocols that
    use SRV records (RFC 2782) to indirectly name the target server connection endpoints
    for a service domain name cannot apply the rules from RFC 6698.  Therefore, this
    document provides guidelines that enable such protocols to locate and use TLSA
    records.
