abstract:
- content: This document specifies a distributed algorithm for dividing a set of prefixes
    in a manner that allows for automatic assignment of sub-prefixes that are unique
    and non-overlapping.  Used in conjunction with a protocol that provides flooding
    of information among a set of participating nodes, prefix configuration within
    a network may be automated.
