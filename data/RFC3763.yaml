abstract:
  content: With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes
    increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision.  To
    do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements is required.  This
    document specifies requirements for a one-way active measurement protocol (OWAMP)
    standard.  The protocol can measure one-way delay, as well as other unidirectional
    characteristics, such as one-way loss.  This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.
