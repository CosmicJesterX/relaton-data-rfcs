abstract:
  content: The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem protocol
    which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike
    earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access
    while integrating support for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition,
    support for strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
    caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course, attention has been
    applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.  This
    document replaces RFC 3010 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
