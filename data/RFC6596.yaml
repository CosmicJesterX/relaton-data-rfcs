abstract:
  content: RFC 5988 specifies a way to define relationships between links on the web.  This
    document describes a new type of such a relationship, "canonical", to designate
    an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) as preferred over resources with
    duplicative content.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.
