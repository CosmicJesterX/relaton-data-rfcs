abstract:
- content: In this document, we analyze the applicability of the Loop-Free Alternate
    (LFA) method of providing IP fast reroute in both the core and access parts of
    Service Provider networks.  We consider both the link and node failure cases,
    and provide guidance on the applicability of LFAs to different network topologies,
    with special emphasis on the access parts of the network.  This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.
