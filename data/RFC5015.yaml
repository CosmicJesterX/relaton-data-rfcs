abstract:
- content: This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM
    Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources
    and receivers.  Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder
    (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With
    the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to
    the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without
    requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery
    time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven
    protocol events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
