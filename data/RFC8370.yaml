abstract:
  content: Networks that utilize RSVP-TE LSPs are encountering implementations that
    have a limited ability to support the growth in the number of LSPs deployed. This
    document defines two techniques, Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) and
    Per-Peer Flow Control, that reduce the number of processing cycles required to
    maintain RSVP-TE LSP state in Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and hence allow implementations
    to support larger scale deployments.
