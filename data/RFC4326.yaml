abstract:
  content: The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) has been widely accepted not only for
    providing digital TV services, but also as a subnetwork technology for building
    IP networks. This document describes a Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
    (ULE) mechanism for the transport of IPv4 and IPv6 Datagrams and other network
    protocol packets directly over the ISO MPEG-2 Transport Stream as TS Private Data.
    ULE specifies a base encapsulation format and supports an extension format that
    allows it to carry additional header information to assist in network/Receiver
    processing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
