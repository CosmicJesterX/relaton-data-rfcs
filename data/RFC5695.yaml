abstract:
  content: This document describes a methodology specific to the benchmarking of Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) forwarding devices, limited to the most common MPLS packet
    forwarding scenarios and delay measurements for each, considering IP flows.  It
    builds upon the tenets set forth in RFC 2544, RFC 1242, and other IETF Benchmarking
    Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This document seeks to extend these
    efforts to the MPLS paradigm.  This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.
