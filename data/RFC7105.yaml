abstract:
  content: This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-related
    measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within a request for location
    information.  Location-related measurement information provides observations concerning
    properties related to the position of a Device; this information could be data
    about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to
    use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location
    estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements
    are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.
