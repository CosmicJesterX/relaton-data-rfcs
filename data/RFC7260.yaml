abstract:
  content: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is an integral part of
    transport connections; hence, it is required that OAM functions be activated/deactivated
    in sync with connection commissioning/ decommissioning, in order to avoid spurious
    alarms and ensure consistent operation.  In certain technologies, OAM entities
    are inherently established once the connection is set up, while other technologies
    require extra configuration to establish and configure OAM entities.  This document
    specifies extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
    to support the establishment and configuration of OAM entities along with Label
    Switched Path signaling.
