abstract:
- content: This document recommends that RFC 1888, on Open Systems Interconnection
    (OSI) Network Service Access Points (NSAPs) and IPv6, be reclassified as Historic,
    as most of it has no further value, apart from one section, which is faulty.  This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.
