abstract:
  content: This framework describes a practical methodology for benchmarking the traffic
    management capabilities of networking devices (i.e., policing, shaping, etc.).  The
    goals are to provide a repeatable test method that objectively compares performance
    of the device's traffic management capabilities and to specify the means to benchmark
    traffic management with representative application traffic.
