abstract:
  content: 'This memo is the official specification of the File Transfer Protocol
    (FTP) for the DARPA Internet community.  The primary intent is to clarify and
    correct the documentation of the FTP specification, not to change the protocol.  The
    following new optional commands are included in this edition of the specification:
    Change to Parent Directory (CDUP), Structure Mount (SMNT), Store Unique (STOU),
    Remove Directory (RMD), Make Directory (MKD), Print Directory (PWD), and System
    (SYST).  Note that this specification is compatible with the previous edition.'
