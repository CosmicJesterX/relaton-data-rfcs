  content: This document addresses the issues of the discovery of URN (Uniform Resource
    Name) resolver services that in turn will directly translate URNs into URLs (Uniform
    Resource Locators) and URCs (Uniform Resource Characteristics).  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard
    of any kind.
