abstract:
  content: Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the Internet
    when moving from one Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover.  During
    handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or
    receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This
    "handover latency" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement
    detection, new Care of Address configuration, and Binding Update, is often unacceptable
    to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP.  Reducing the handover latency could
    be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This
    document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This
    document does not address improving the link switching latency.  This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
