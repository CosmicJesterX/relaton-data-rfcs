abstract:
  content: The concept of channel binding allows applications to establish that the
    two end-points of a secure channel at one network layer are the same as at a higher
    layer by binding authentication at the higher layer to the channel at the lower
    layer. This allows applications to delegate session protection to lower layers,
    which has various performance benefits. This document discusses and formalizes
    the concept of channel binding to secure channels. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
