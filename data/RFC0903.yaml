abstract:
- content: This RFC suggests a method for workstations to dynamically find their protocol
    address (e.g., their Internet Address), when they know only their hardware address
    (e.g., their attached physical network address).  This RFC specifies a proposed
    protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.
