abstract:
  content: This document focuses on the problems encountered when using dynamic DNS
    in address-sharing contexts (e.g., Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) and Network Address
    and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64)) during IPv6
    transition.  Both issues and possible solutions are documented in this memo.
