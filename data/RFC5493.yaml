abstract:
- content: From a carrier perspective, the possibility of turning a permanent connection
    (PC) into a soft permanent connection (SPC) and vice versa, without actually affecting
    data plane traffic being carried over it, is a valuable option. In other terms,
    such operation can be seen as a way of transferring the ownership and control
    of an existing and in-use data plane connection between the management plane and
    the control plane, leaving its data plane state untouched. This memo sets out
    the requirements for such procedures within a Generalized Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) network. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
