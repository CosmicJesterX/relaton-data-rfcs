abstract:
  content: This document describes a file system federation protocol that enables
    file access and namespace traversal across collections of independently administered
    fileservers.  The protocol specifies a set of interfaces by which fileservers
    with different administrators can form a fileserver federation that provides a
    namespace composed of the file systems physically hosted on and exported by the
    constituent fileservers.
