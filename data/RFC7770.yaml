abstract:
  content: It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to know
    the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the routing domain.  This
    document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for advertising optional router
    capabilities.  The Router Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is defined
    for this purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with an Opaque LSA
    type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a unique LSA type function
    code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be advertised at any of the defined flooding
    scopes (link, area, or autonomous system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970
    by providing a revised specification that includes support for advertisement of
    multiple instances of the RI LSA and a TLV for functional capabilities.
