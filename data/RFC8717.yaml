abstract:
  content: In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative structure
    and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0"
    structure.  In addition to more substantive changes that are described in other
    documents, the transition to the 2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes
    several position titles and organizational relationships that are referenced elsewhere.  Rather
    than reissue those referencing documents individually, this specification provides
    updates to them and deprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there
    is no confusion due to these changes.
