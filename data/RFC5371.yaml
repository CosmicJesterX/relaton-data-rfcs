abstract:
  content: This memo describes an RTP payload format for the ISO/IEC International
    Standard 15444-1 | ITU-T Rec.  T.800, better known as JPEG 2000.  JPEG 2000 features
    are considered in the design of this payload format.  JPEG 2000 is a truly scalable
    compression technology allowing applications to encode once and decode many different
    ways.  The JPEG 2000 video stream is formed by extending from a single image to
    a series of JPEG 2000 images. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
