abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for applying or extending the MPLS or
    GMPLS ((G)MPLS) protocol suites and clarifies the IETF's (G)MPLS working groups'
    responsibility for the (G)MPLS protocols.  This document is directed to multi-vendor
    fora and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) to provide an understanding
    of (G)MPLS work in the IETF and documents the requisite use of IETF review procedures
    when considering (G)MPLS applications or protocol extensions in their work.  This
    document does not modify IETF processes.  This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.
