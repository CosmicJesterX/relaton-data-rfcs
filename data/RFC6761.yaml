abstract:
  content: This document describes what it means to say that a Domain Name (DNS name)
    is reserved for special use, when reserving such a name is appropriate, and the
    procedure for doing so.  It establishes an IANA registry for such domain names,
    and seeds it with entries for some of the already established special domain names.
