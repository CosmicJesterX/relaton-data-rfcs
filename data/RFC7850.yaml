abstract:
  content: 'The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification establishes a registry
    of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the Session
    Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to the transport methods.  This specification
    describes the following new SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting
    RTP Media over TCP: ''TCP/RTP/AVPF'', ''TCP/RTP/SAVP'', ''TCP/RTP/SAVPF'', ''TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP'',
    ''TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF'', ''TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP'', and ''TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF''.'
