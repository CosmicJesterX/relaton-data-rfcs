abstract:
- content: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent
    data interchange format. It was derived from the ECMAScript Programming Language
    Standard. JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation
    of structured data. This document removes inconsistencies with other specifications
    of JSON, repairs specification errors, and offers experience-based interoperability
    guidance.
