abstract:
  content: Zstandard, or "zstd" (pronounced "zee standard"), is a lossless data compression
    mechanism. This document describes the mechanism and registers a media type, content
    encoding, and a structured syntax suffix to be used when transporting zstd-compressed
    content via MIME. Despite use of the word "standard" as part of Zstandard, readers
    are advised that this document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is being published for informational purposes only. This document replaces
    and obsoletes RFC 8478.
