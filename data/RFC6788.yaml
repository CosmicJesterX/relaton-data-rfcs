abstract:
  content: In Ethernet-based aggregation networks, several subscriber premises may
    be logically connected to the same interface of an Edge Router.  This document
    proposes a method for the Edge Router to identify the subscriber premises using
    the contents of the received Router Solicitation messages.  The applicability
    is limited to broadband network deployment scenarios in which multiple user ports
    are mapped to the same virtual interface on the Edge Router. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
