abstract:
- content: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment.  However,
    domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as those
    for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.  This document
    defines Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs), which can be used to mitigate DNSSEC validation
    failures by disabling DNSSEC validation at specified domains.
