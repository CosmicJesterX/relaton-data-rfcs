abstract:
  content: This document describes an RTP payload format for transporting Vorbis encoded
    audio. It details the RTP encapsulation mechanism for raw Vorbis data and the
    delivery mechanisms for the decoder probability model (referred to as a codebook),
    as well as other setup information. Also included within this memo are media type
    registrations and the details necessary for the use of Vorbis with the Session
    Description Protocol (SDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
